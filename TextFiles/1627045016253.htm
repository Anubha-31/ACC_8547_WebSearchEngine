Hello Ankita, it's very nice to hear from you that you desire to join IAF. When you SEE the advertisement you can SEE that as to when this particular course is commencing. From this you can surely make out as to whether by this date your results will be declared or not. Indian Air Force does not accept students whose results are not declared for whatever reasons by the time students have to submit their documents. Normally speaking those who are in the final year of engineering course can definitely take this examination. Best wishes to you.

Hello M Vinay. I can understand your angst and anxiety. For all purposes Diploma is considered as equivalent to 12thand hence you are definitely eligible to appear for AFCAT. Where ever they talk of 12th, you assume it to be for Diploma. Fill up the form and don't worry. Best wishes to you.
