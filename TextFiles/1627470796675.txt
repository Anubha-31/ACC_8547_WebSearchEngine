LPU NEST (Lovely Professional University National Eligibility &amp; Entrance Test) is a National Level test conducted by LPU in Online Proctored mode this year. Means student can take up this exam online through any of the means Laptop / Desktop / Android Mobile phone. Every year almost 5 Lacs aspirants used to take up this Exam. For many purpose like Study Grant or Admission or Scholarship, more over capability index judgement. Valid score card of LPU NEST 2021 exam is mandatory for taking admission in most of the courses in LPU, but for some courses students could take direct admission. For both the cases, performance in LPU NEST would be considered for scholarship purpose also. Like for B.Tech. CSE LPU NEST is mandatory but for M.Tech. CSE it's not. You need to register yourself in the online portal of LPU &amp; then apply online for the LPU NEST examination. LPU NEST Examination is very transparent in nature. This is a National Level test &amp; this is like competitive type of Exam. Ranking of the students is actually get published after every phase of Exam. Student could prepare themselves by downloading Syllabus, Question Paper Pattern, Previous Years question paper, sample question etc. As per my experience, if any student study well &amp; keep focus on subjects, LPU NEST will not be tough to them. There is a provision of taking up practice Test as well before final LPU NEST Exam. Student will get Excellent Scholarship based on the performance. During my study in LPU, I got the highest benefit of scholarship for all semesters throughout my study based on performance of LPU NEST only. Scholarship through LPU NEST depends upon the cut off set for the specific subject which is very nominal as per my understanding. So have faith on you &amp; keep Practicing. All the Best !
