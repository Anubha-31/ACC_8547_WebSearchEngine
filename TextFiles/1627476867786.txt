Hello Janhavi, yes the admissions in VJTI are based on the ranking in MHT CET examination conducted by the state of Maharashtra. For candidates domiciled outside Maharashtra they can SEE admission based on their JEE Mains ranking under what is called as all India quota. Best wishes to you.

Hello Janhavi, not taking JEE Mains is no issue. You must appear for and score well in MHT CET conducted by Maharashtra for becoming eligible for admission in VJTI. Perhaps only private engineering colleges can give you admission based on 12th marks under management quota. Best wishes to you.

Hello Kaif Khan, in any branch of engineering little bit of mathematics is always required and therefore is a part of the syllabus. Do not get too much worried by this. You can always take tuitions from the concerned teachers or from outside to clear the paper of mathematics in couple of semesters that must be there. Don't worry. Normally all students clear this papers since they are not very complex but are only concerning their application in engineering Best wishes to you.
