The student life at IIM Lucknow from campus, placement perspective.

The 'Hel (L)' in which you'll want to stay forever.

Placements:
All students were placed. For senior batch, there was an impact of demonetization and placements were not as good as ours. Students were offered role in consulting firms, finance and marketing majorly. Almost 90% students took internship from college. Stipend varies from 15k to 2lakh/month.

Infrastructure:
Great infrastructure. Classrooms are well-equipped with all basic facilities and amenities like Projector, Centralized AC, comfortable seats etc. Quality of food is undoubtedly one of the best part at campus....

IIM Lucknow - A brief review of the campus at large.

Placements:
Placements have been sanguine. All top recruiters visited and IIM L soared high. Yet another season of record placements. It was a remarkable year, going by the placement figures. PlaceComm did a commendable job so did the batch of students. A record placement was concluded in 2 days. Isn't that great? That's the grandiose of IIM Lucknow.

Infrastructure:
IIM L is a lush green campus amidst posts of trees and beautiful buildings. The quintessential red bricks add the flavour of a B-School to help (L). It has all...

Placements are in particular with PGP students. In 2019, it has proven to surpass PGP placements may be due to the low batch size.

In a nutshell, this college is extremely good in terms of placements, infrastructure and faculty.

Placements:
Placements for this course are similar to that of the regular PGP course. There were almost 100% placements for the 2019 batch.

Review of IIM Lucknow - Indian Institute of Management (IIML).

Placements:
This is one of the few MBA schools to offer very good placements. There are 100% placements with very reputed companies coming in to take candidates for both the summer internships and final placements. The students here actually have the advantage as they get to choose the companies for themselves rather than the other way round which happens in most of the other B-schools across the country. This is what makes IIM Lucknow one of the best colleges for MBA education.
