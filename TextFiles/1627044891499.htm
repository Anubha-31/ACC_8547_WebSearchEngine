Dear Samiksha, MBA after B.Tech is a very good career option because diversity of subjects taught at an undergraduate level is quite narrow compared to an MBA Degree. Many students opt for an MBA because they feel it is the right path for a lucrative career; its the only logical option for them as it allows them to climb the organizational ladder faster. Here are top MBA specializations that will strike the chord of an MBA aspirant: 1- MBA in Business Analytics, 2- MBA in HR, 3- MBA in Marketing, 4- MBA in Finance, 5- MBA in Entrepreneurship, 6- MBA in Insurance &amp; Risk Management, 7- MBA in Operation Management, 8- MBA in Logistics Management. The main objective of an MBA is to master fundamental business and managerial skills in a student. Every specialisation have their own rewarding career paths in their own way. Benefits of MBA after B.Tech - Technology plays an important role in businesses, so students with the knowledge of technology and business and finance get the privilege in the business world. Their technical skills can be used by multinational companies as well. Technical skills are always in trend and without management, no company can run well. Technical and management skills are the core strength of any company. For this reason, a person with these two skills is the best choice that a company could make. Most of the big companies in the IT sector hires graduates from decent colleges having both the B.Tech. And an MBA degree. Big brands are attracted by these people having two degrees of management and technology. Best colleges for an MBA is IILM University, Gurugram, Amity University, Apeejay school of management, Jagan institute of management studies and many more. Hope this help!

Most Important: Most of the reviews about Chandigarh University (CU) is written by college online it cell itself on various sites by using fake ids. So be very careful and real the condition below carefully. * I guess you must be the same student as I was 1 year ago desperately searching for a good college as it is one of the important factors for a good and decent future and in the way of searching this good college I came to know about a university that promised to fulfill every demand that my better and decent future was demanding. So I called them and asked every question my mind was full of but a strange thing happened while cutting the call last line CU representative told me was there are just 4 seats left. So you will have to decide within next 10 minutes. Strange ! Now I have to decide my whole future in just 10 minutes. I was already too exhausted searching colleges for me. So in hurry or in pressure that they created for me, I got trapped in there plan and took admission here. And then the real game begun, at first every thing was like paradise. Every wish of new Students were fulfilled like we are god or modi :p and all that because they thought that if we will treat them good then they might call their friends for admission but as soon as time passed and all classes gets started (which happened till last of october) they started showing their colors. In just 5 months everything changed. Food Became the worst. Teaching (leave it, you will cry if I will write about it) Internet (They claim they have full campus, if this is true, then I guess I am living outside campus from last year because I haven't seen open Wi-Fi anywhere in campus. ) Even They Bloked the good and useful site like javatpoint. Just to save bandwidhth money now you must got an idea if they can block a study related site, just think the condition of other sites.

While there is nothing much to say about ATMIYA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY &amp; Science (MCA). It is overall all a good college. But if you ask me about Lexicon MILE, they offer many unique and extremely helpful experiences for their students. Some of them being: 1. the finest Academic Delivery by Iims, IIT's &amp; Foreign faculty members 2. Dual Major specialisation 3. &quot;&quot;One Student a Time&quot;&quot; approach to ensure every student's growth &amp; development 4. 20+ additional certification along with PGDM makes you more industry ready 5. Regular Industrial visits 6. Paid internships in the final year for minimum duration of 9 months It has been the talk of the town lately.

Hello Jainesh, it's very nice to hear from you that you are interested in doing your Masters from abroad. Let me assure you that it's the best aim that you have kept for yourself. Now, admissions abroad are very interesting. These are not based on your academic performance in graduation but on many other things. Hence I would like to advise you to approach an agency that is dealing with sending students abroad for PG. They will guide you correctly. Best wishes to you.

RANIBAI AGNIHOTRI INSTITUTE OF COMPUTER &amp; INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY is good. But if you are considering a career in management do check out Lexicon Management Institute of Leadership and Excellence. Their infrastructure is grand and amongst the best campuses I have ever seen. They provide students a minimum 9 months paid internship in the second year. This will increase your ROI to a great extent.

BHARATI VIDYAPEETH'S INSTITUTE OF MANAGEMENT AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY NAVI MUMBAI wants to imbibe ethical usage of technical knowledge to the society. Therein they give an environment that fosters a framework for promoting collaborative and multidisciplinary activities. I would suggest you opt for Lexicon MILE Pune, as the brand image carried by the college is much higher and also the placement scenario is slightly better.
