Mensuration




Last Updated :
03 Jun, 2021

is a branch of mathematics concerned with the calculation of geometric figures and their parameters such as weight, volume, form, surface area, lateral surface area, and so on. In simple mathematics, you can learn about mensuration. The principles of mensuration are discussed here, as are all the essential mensuration formulas.
Mensuration


For a better understanding of these ideas, the properties of various geometric forms and the accompanying figures are also shown. Mensuration is a branch of mathematics that deals with the scale, volume, or area of various geometric forms. These forms are available in or .
two
three dimensions

Mensuration of 2D shapes
Mensuration is the measuring theory. It is the field of mathematics that is used to measure various figures such as the cube, cuboid, square, rectangle, cylinder, and so on. Mensuration of two-dimensional figures such as area, perimeter, and so on. The form or figure having two dimensions, such as length and breadth, is referred to as a 2-D form. A 2-D figure is something like a square, rectangle, triangle, parallelogram, trapezium, rhombus, and so on. We can measure 2-D forms using Area (A) and Perimeter (P) as discussed below:

Area of 2D Shapes

Mensuration of 3D shapes
Mensuration is concerned with the measuring of three-dimensional solids in terms of total surface area, lateral/curved surface area, and volume. 3D figures are those that have more than two dimensions, such as length, breadth, and height. Cube, Cuboid, Sphere, Cylinder, Cone, and other three-dimensional forms are examples. Total Surface Area, Lateral Surface Area, Curved Surface Area, and Volume are used to calculate the 3D figure are discussed in the articles below:
