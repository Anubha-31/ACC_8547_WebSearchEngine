What is Ceramic Engineering?



Ceramic engineering is an emerging and developing branch of engineering that deals with the study of the manufacture, properties, design and uses of ceramic related things. Ceramic engineers are involved in manufacturing objects which assist computers and electronic devices operate, enhance the health of individuals in various ways and help in the global telecommunication process. Ceramic engineering course prepares students concerning the manufacturing aspect of ceramic designs and their properties.
Applications of ceramic engineering are witnessing an expansion owing to current advances in the domain of chemistry and physics, comprising ceramics that encompass bio-ceramics like synthetic bones and dental implants. Students who aspire to establish a career in ceramic engineering are certain to find themselves laden with an extensive range of job prospects. To seek a career in ceramic engineering, aspirants should have an engineering degree in the same. Colleges across India offer graduation and post-graduation level courses in ceramic engineering.
Eligibility Criteria to pursue Ceramic Engineering
Ceramic engineering is relatively a new and fascinating course in the domain of engineering courses which deals with the comprehensive study, properties, design and designing, manufacturing, applications and utilisation of ceramic materials. Ceramic engineering is a perfect combination of technology and art for aspirants who are creative and aim to study the flawless process of manufacturing objects from non-metallic and inorganic materials.
: To pursue in Ceramic Engineering, the eligibility criteria for admission is having passed XII examination from any recognised board with Chemistry/Mathematics/Physics as the major subjects, with minimum aggregate marks of 50 per cent.
Under-Graduation
BE/B.Tech
: To pursue in Ceramic Engineering, the eligibility criteria for admission is aspirants must have completed their BE/B.Tech in Mechanical/Production/Ceramic/Metallurgical/Automobile/Aeronautical/Marine/Mechatronics/Manufacturing/Industrial from any recognised university with minimum aggregate marks of 55-60 per cent (can vary from college to college)
Post-Graduation
M.Tech/ME
Skills required to be a Ceramic Engineer
Ceramic engineers are specialised engineers who work with inorganic ceramics and non-metallic materials which are processed at very high temperatures. Ceramic engineers work with a vast range of products, spanning from electronic and glassware components to nuclear reactors and linings for jet engines and blast furnaces. Therefore, aspiring ceramic engineers should have a sound understanding of the policies and processes of working with several different forms of ceramic materials. The key skills required for pursuing a ceramic engineering course are:








Communication Skills

Comprehend written and spoken information, read and comprehend work-related material, and actively listen to others


Reasoning and Problem-Solving

Identify complex problems and review related information and think of unique, unusual, or innovative ways to solve problems, develop and appraise options and implement solutions


Manage Self, People, Things and Time

Manage time of self as well others, and motivate, develop, and guide people as they work and identify the right people for the job


Mathematics and Science Skills

Using mathematical formula or method and/or scientific methods to solve problems


Learning Strategies

Selecting and utilising instructional/training methods and techniques apt for the situation when teaching or learning new things


Management of Material Resources

Obtaining and ensuring the correct utilisation of equipment, materials and facilities required to do specific work.


Quality Control Analysis

Undertaking tests and inspections of products/processes to assess quality or performance
Admission Process and Course Fees
For admissions to under-graduation courses, candidates must go through a rigorous process of clearing national-level and state-level entrance tests for obtaining admission into different colleges/universities/institutes. Some colleges/universities/institutes have their separate entrance exams for the admission process. In some cases, colleges may also offer direct admission on merit-basis, that is, as per 10+2 examination. For admissions to ME/M.Tech courses in the top engineering colleges in India aspirants must clear the examination. However, some colleges/universities/institutes have their separate entrance exams followed by personal interview and counselling for the admission process.
