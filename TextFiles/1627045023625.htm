Becoming a lawyer is not the only job profile one can pursue after completing their law courses. Aspirants can also make their law careers in the mentioned below:

job profiles




Law Job Profile

Description



Lawyer

In this job profile aspirants are also sometimes referred to as advocates. A lawyer mostly represents one of the parties/ clients in a trial at court. As part of this job profile, one needs to cross examine witnesses and then list reasons/ facts around why the court should give the judgement in favour of their clients.



Legal Advisors

In this job profile, one is expected to counsel clients on legal rights and obligations. Legal advisors mostly research laws applicable to a particular case and thereafter go through previous judgements passed in cases similar to the one their client is currently facing and thereafter help them in listing out how they can defend themselves.



Judges

As a Judge one has to ensure that justice is administered and legal rights of all the involved parties are safeguarded. A Judge presides over trials/hearings wherein s/he has to listen to the case presented by lawyers.



Solicitors

Solicitors give legal advice and represent their client in legal matters. Solicitors mostly work for firms which take up cases related to their area of work.



Legal Executives

People opting to work for such a job profile typically advise their employers on legal matters. They also work on litigation cases for their firm. They also perform administrative functions along with handling in-house legal problems such as checking deeds, issuing writs, collecting information for affidavits as well as draft legal documents. Legal executives also represent their business house when they discuss legal issues with other firms.



Notary Public


Notaries are appointed by the central government for the whole or specific part of the country. The various State governments also appoint notaries who work for the whole or a specific part of the state. Any person who has been practicing Law (as a lawyer) for minimum ten years is eligible to apply for a notary post. As per the Notaries Act 1952, the function of a Notary is as follows:

To verify, authenticate, certify or attest the execution of any instrument
To administer oath to or take an affidavit from any person
To translate and verify the translation, of any document from one language into another
To act as commissioner, to record evidence in any civil or criminal trial if so directed by the court or authority
To act as arbitrator, mediator, or conciliator if so required



Oath Commissioners

Anyone who works under this job profile is authorised to verify affidavits. An Oath Commissioner is appointed by the Chief Justice and is usually (though not always) a solicitor. The functions of an Oath Commissioner are as follows:

Makes sure that the evidence in question is in written form (the draft affidavit)
Establishes that the person before him/her has read the draft affidavit and fully understands the contents
Makes a person swear that the affidavit is true by raising the appropriate Testament in the right hand and repeating the words of the oath
Verifies that the affidavit was properly sworn by completing a "jurat" on the affidavit
