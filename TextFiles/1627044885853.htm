Hello Sourabh Panwar, It's Indeed a great to hear from you that you are now interested in doing your post graduation studies in the specialisation of Computer sciences. I can understand as you are employed somewhere you cannot find time for regular college and hence are interested in a part time study. Unfortunately information of such colleges is not available on the net readily. I can suggest you a very simple thing. You can definitely find out the name addresses and telephone numbers of all engineering colleges in the place where you are at the moment living and working. Once you do this then start ringing up one by one and finding out if they offer part time postgraduate course in the branch that you desire. Once you get hit then you can go to the college to find for other required formalities before you can begin your studies. Best wishes to you.

Hello Rishu, it's indeed great to know that you are interested in doing your PG and doctorate inspite of having completed your graduation eight years ago. Unfortunately professional courses are not available by correspondence and you need to take admission and physically attend classes. This you can do only if there is college offering PG in part time or evening classes mode. I am afraid this information is not available on net and you will have to ring up each college where you live to find status. Alternatively you can think of pursuing any other course by distance mode. Just download brochure cum application form of IGNOU. There are plenty of courses that you can do. Best wishes to you.

A career in B.Tech offers immense growth as demand for professionals is always on a high. Job opportunities exist right after the programme.

Engineering at Chandigarh University is setting a benchmark every year that is on a subtle higher inclination.

The highest package offered to the students last year at Chandigarh University was 31.7 lac. More than 500 companies including global IT giant such as Google, Microsoft, Deloitte, etc. , and other renowned firms such as Amazon, Wipro, Haier, HP, etc. are frequent recruiters here.

Most Important: Most of the reviews about Chandigarh University (CU) is written by college online it cell itself on various sites by using fake ids. So be very careful and real the condition below carefully. * I guess you must be the same student as I was 1 year ago desperately searching for a good college as it is one of the important factors for a good and decent future and in the way of searching this good college I came to know about a university that promised to fulfill every demand that my better and decent future was demanding. So I called them and asked every question my mind was full of but a strange thing happened while cutting the call last line CU representative told me was there are just 4 seats left. So you will have to decide within next 10 minutes. Strange ! Now I have to decide my whole future in just 10 minutes. I was already too exhausted searching colleges for me. So in hurry or in pressure that they created for me, I got trapped in there plan and took admission here. And then the real game begun, at first every thing was like paradise. Every wish of new Students were fulfilled like we are god or modi :p and all that because they thought that if we will treat them good then they might call their friends for admission but as soon as time passed and all classes gets started (which happened till last of october) they started showing their colors. In just 5 months everything changed. Food Became the worst. Teaching (leave it, you will cry if I will write about it) Internet (They claim they have full campus, if this is true, then I guess I am living outside campus from last year because I haven't seen open Wi-Fi anywhere in campus. ) Even They Bloked the good and useful site like javatpoint. Just to save bandwidhth money now you must got an idea if they can block a study related site, just think the condition of other sites.

Hello Ankit Kumar, yes if your intended institution does not require GATE score for admission in M.Tech, then definitely you don't have to appear for GATE. You can readily come to know this aspect by just downloading and reading the information brochure of this institution. Best wishes to you.

Hello Ajaikrishna, the fees are for first year only. It is however a fact that students can earn while learn during PG courses and lessen the burden on parents. Best wishes to you.
