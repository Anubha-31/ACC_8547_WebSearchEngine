Seriously! I don't know about these colleges or universities. But Yes I can tell you about LPU. I have completed my MBA from LPU and I believe that LPU is one of the best universities among all the B schools as well as other ranked universities. I will share certain facts which would justify the same. 1. Accreditation: As LPU got accreditation from Accreditation Council of Business Schools and Programs, USA (ACBSP). Not only LPU is highly accredited but also it is having numerous international tie ups for instance university of North Alabama, Livingstone College etc. 2. Size: LPU is spread over 600 acres campus consisting of 3000+students and 3500+ faculty members and staff. Students are taking the admissions not from all over India but across the borders as well which make me feel that I am in a foreign land. 3. Ranking: LPU has following ranking: 1. Impact rankings 2021 2. National Employability Award 2020 by Aspiring Minds 3. Outlook has ranked LPU as 5th among top 50 universities 4. Knowledge Review rated LPU as 10 th among Best training and Placement Institute 4. Infrastructure: LPU in itself a town as all the amenities a student could found at one place there is no need to move out of the campus. From Central Library to Hospital, Bank, ATMs, JIM facility, swimming pool. A student could enjoy his or her life in the best way. 5. Placements: LPU is having outstanding Placements record for the students. As every year not only national companies but also international ones are also hiring the LPU students for instance Amazon offers 30 Lacs package per annum. The Corporates which have visited the campus are Microsoft, Amazon, DBS Bank etc. 6. Faculty: LPU composed of the best faculty members from IIM, IITs and the other best B schools. 7. Upgraded Approach: LPU is highly upgraded in its parameters as it includes paperless attendance, online assignments, submission etc. We can also raise our grievances online itself.

Dear Saksham, I don't have any idea about IMT, XIME, or IBS, but being alumni of LPU, I can share the placements details with you at LPU only, LPU created a new record in the whole of North India by placing its student Tanya Arora with Microsoft, who bagged a package of 42 LPA. Besides, other record-breaking placements for LPU includes: the highest Placement (Engineering) Rs. 42 Lacs per annum (Microsoft) the highest Placement (Management) Rs. 19.75 Lacs per annum (SOBHA Developers) the highest Placement (Design) Rs. 36.5 Lacs per annum (SIXT India) Amazon recruited LPU students on a package of 28 LPA The highest internship stipend is up to 80k per month. (which is really hard to get in other universities) The reason why LPU has better placement records than other universities is because of its unique career cell. It enables students in getting relevant work experience to complement their studies and develop appropriate skills and knowledge. Resume writing, aptitude development workshops among other activities are hosted for the overall development of students and prepare them to crack the interviews easily. Alumni of LPU are working with top-notch brands globally with a package of more than 1 crore. Right from Google to Apple, students are working worldwide. Some of the top recruiters are Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Accenture, Cognizant, Amazon, TCS, IBM, Informatica, Capgemini, SAP, Infosys, Tech Mahindra, Bosch, Ashok Leyland, Voltas, Mercedes Benz, Honda, Daikin, Renault Nissan, Sony, Adobe, Virtusa, KPIT, Morgan Stanley, Hindustan Unilever Ltd, Trident Group, Infineon, KPMG, Colgate-Palmolive and the list still goes on. I hope this answer is helpful to you. !

I am quite sure of other colleges but my cousin graduated from PIBM. As far as I know, PIBM has unique training methods updated and designed as per the industry requirements. They have regular corporate events, IVs, dual internships, and much more. Apart from this, the students undergo special training in communication and aptitude which is quite essential in this competitive corporate world. Even during the pandemic, PIBM ensured that the placements and internship process continues through online mode. All the best!
