It is a great college if you want to study.

Placements:
The placements in our college are great, but it varies from person to person. A person can get a great package or the worst. It all depends on the calibre of the person and performance in the interview. You should have a clear understanding of the things you want to achieve, and then, go for it.

Infrastructure:
FMS lacks infrastructure, but this won't stop you from excelling yourself. The fee structure is low, and the infrastructure is very poor. Overall, it lacks good infrastructure needed for any college.
