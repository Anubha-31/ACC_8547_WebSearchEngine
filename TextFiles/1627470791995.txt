What is Genetic Engineering?



Genetic Engineering additionally called genetic modification or genetic manipulation is the immediate control of a living being's genes using biotechnology. It is an arrangement of innovations used to change the hereditary forms of cells, including the exchange of qualities inside and across species limits to create enhanced or novel living beings.
Genetic Engineering has been connected in various fields including research, medicine, industrial biotechnology and agriculture. In research, GMOs are utilized to contemplate quality capacity and articulation through loss of function, gain of function, tracking and expression experiments. By thumping out genes responsible for specific conditions it is possible to create animal model organisms of human diseases. And in addition to producing hormones, immunizations and different drug genetic engineering can possibly fix hereditary diseases through quality treatment. Similar strategies that are utilized to create medications can likewise have mechanical applications, for example, producing enzymes for detergents, cheeses and different products.




The ascent of commercialised genetically modified crops has given a financial advantage to agriculturists in a wide range of nations, however, has additionally been the wellspring of a large portion of the debate encompassing the innovation. This has been available since its initial implementation, the primary field trials were destroyed by anti-GM activists. In spite of the fact that there is a logical accord that at presently accessible sustenance got from GM crops represents no more serious hazard to human wellbeing than regular nourishment, GM sustenance security is the main concern with critics.
Required Skillset for Genetic Engineering
Genetic engineering is the study of genes and the science of heredity. Genetic engineers or geneticists study living organisms ranging from human being to crops and even bacteria.
These professionals also conduct researches which is a major part of their work profile. The experiments are conducted to determine the origin and governing laws of a particular inherited trait. These traits include medical condition, diseases etc. The study is further used to seek our determinants responsible for the inherited trait.
Genetic engineers or Geneticists keep on finding ways to enhance their work profile depending on the place and organization they are working with. In manufacturing, these professionals will develop new pharmaceutical or agricultural products while in a medical setting, they advise patients on the diagnosed medical conditions that are inherited and also treat patients on the same.





Skill sets for Genetic engineers or Geneticists


Strong understanding of scientific methods and rules

complex problem solving and critical thinking


ability to use computer-aided design (CAD)

graphics or photo imaging


PERL, Python

word processing software programs


excellent mathematical, deductive and inductive reasoning, reading, writing, and oral comprehension skills

ability to use lasers spectrometers, light scattering equipment, binocular light compound microscopes, bench top centrifuges, or similar laboratory equipment
Typical responsibilities of a Genetic Engineering or Geneticist includes:

conducting lab research and trials
extracting DNA or performing analytic tests
interpreting, checking on or favouring hereditary lab results
documenting their procedures and results
analysing hereditary information to make determinations and distribute look into
communicating aftereffects of discoveries, for example at meetings or in logical diaries
supervising or coordinating crafted by different geneticists, scientists, specialists or biometricians chipping away at hereditary qualities explore ventures
initiating new research at a senior level
When a genetic engineer gains a year of experience, one of the regions they can indulge into is hereditary advising, which includes offering data, support and counsel on hereditary conditions to your patients.





Genetic Engineering Eligibility Criteria
An individual aspiring to pursue a professional degree in Genetic Engineering can begin the BTech course after his/her 10+2 Science with Physics, Chemistry, Maths and Biology.
Admission to BTech in Genetic Engineering is made through entrance tests conducted in-house by various universities or through the scores of national engineering entrance examination like JEE for IITs/NITs & CFTIs across the country.
Genetic Engineering professionals require a bachelor’s or master’s degree in Genetic Engineering or Genetic Sciences for entry-level careers. In any case, a doctoral qualification is required for those looking for free research professions. Important fields of study in Genetic Engineering incorporate natural chemistry, biophysics or related fields.
Genetic Engineers require a solid comprehension of logical techniques and guidelines, and in addition complex critical thinking and basic reasoning aptitudes. Phenomenal scientific, deductive and inductive thinking aptitudes, and in addition perusing, composing, and oral cognizance abilities are additionally expected to work in this field.

The latest innovation is that the scientist will develop the double fermentation of the chocolate. Researchers and Scientists at Lovely Professional University (LPU) announced that they have developed a new method to process cocoa beans using double fermentation and produce 100 per cent natural fruit flavored chocolates with atleast 40 per cent higher antioxidant properties. The existing methods of manufacturing fruit flavored chocolates use synthetic fruit flavors which may have adverse effect on consumers health, especially children. The University has been granted a patent for the innovation by India Patent Office, Government of India. The process of double fermentation, along with boosting the antioxidant properties of cocoa, enables the use of natural fruit flavors as well and offers better texture to the chocolate. This double fermentation process utilizes the indigenous microflora present in the pulp /rind and provides natural fruit flavoring to the chocolates. This leads to the enhancement of natural antioxidant properties present in the cocoa beans as well. The additional antioxidants generated are good for health and offer benefits like reduced risk of heart diseases, type 2 diabetes, inflammation and many more.

Hello Shubha Shree, there are varieties of courses including dual degree courses offered by institutions abroad. It includes genetic engineering also. However admissions to institutions abroad are not based exclusively on academic performance but are based on different parameters of a students understanding of the subject. In view of this I would strongly recommend that you should approach an agency that is dealing with sending students abroad for undergraduate and dual degree courses. Best wishes to you.
