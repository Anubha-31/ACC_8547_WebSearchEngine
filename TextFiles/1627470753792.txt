Also consider the return on investment that the course promises. This in turn depends on rankings, acceptance rate, faculty, academic culture and career services associated with the chosen institute at, IILM University, Gurugram have freedom to choose electives from more than one domain as well. This will help you to take a balanced decision. Also one must give equal importance to all the aspects of management because when you climb up the corporate ladder, you are required to perform more than one function and thus the knowledge of different areas come into play.
