Heap Data Structure

Practice Problems on Heap



Recent articles on Heap !
A Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree. Generally, Heaps can be of two types:

: In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be greatest among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.
Max-Heap
: In a Min-Heap the key present at the root node must be minimum among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.
Min-Heap
