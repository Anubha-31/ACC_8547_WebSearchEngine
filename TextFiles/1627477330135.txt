Aug 22nd exam

IMPORTANT: Aug 19 exam date - changed to Aug 22 (Sunday) for NPTEL exam

=================================================================

Dear learner,



Aug 19 exams - changed to Aug 22

Based on your feedback of clashes with other exams and not being able to write NPTEL exams on a weekday (Aug 19th) we worked with our exam partner and were able
to change the exam date
from 19 Aug 2021 to August 22, 2021 (Sunday).
Many of you may have chosen for refund or to write the exam on Aug 19 by filling the form we had circulated. But we need your response/choice again for the new exam date of Aug 22, Sunday as the date may be more convenient for you to write the exam and hence you may not want a refund.

here are
no changes in the Aug 8th exam schedule.

For those of you where more than 2 NPTEL exams fall on the same day because of new scheduling:
