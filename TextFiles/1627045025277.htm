Dear Salon, Glad to hear that you are clear about the course but not sure if you are currently pursuing BA LLB or are looking for a course. So giving a perspective for both situations for your benefit. So to pursue a BA LLB (Hons) course, you would be required to either appear for the entrance test of the university you choose or appear for CLAT / ISAT as this is accepted by most universities. Make sure you choose a university that has a comprehensive curriculum that will enable practical exposure to the subject. In today's day and age it is important that you have an idea about multiple disciplines so as to have a holistic learning experience during the 5 years. Now if you are already pursuing a BA LLB (Hons) programme, make sure you get enough opportunities to network well with the professionals in the field, judges and advocates. The course can also help you prepare well for IAS UPSC exams. Also ensure that you get exposure through internships. If you are considering Delhi NCR as a destination for your further studies, do have a look at DU, IP University and IILM University for their law programs, interdisciplinary approach, great location, experienced faculty, internship and placement opportunity. The entrance process has begun for all courses including BA LLB (Hons) and BBA LLB (Hons). To know more write visit their websites. iilm. edu. in
