Hello Manish, I feel that you have quite good chances to get admission in Thapars. You can take help of large number of college predictors available on the net to get rough idea. However I would strongly recommend that you appear for next round of JEE Mains examination do that you can improve your percentile and enhance chances of getting admission in your desired college. Best wishes to you.

Hello Harsh Surve, With more than 80% in diploma examination I am sure you will get admission in engineering via lateral admission process. But it's very tough to say which college you may get since it depends on very many dynamic things. Best wishes to you.
