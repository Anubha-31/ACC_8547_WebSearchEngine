Also, you get to learn at your pace, without disturbing your fixed schedule. Part-time MBA/PGDM courses are becoming increasingly popular since now people understand the significance of these courses and with the ease, they could be completed.

FAQs Regarding Part-Time MBA


Q: For whom is the Part-time MBA best suited for?
Part-time MBA is best suited for the working professionals who cannot afford to invest the requisite time and funds required for the full-time . This allows them to attend evening or weekend classes, which would let the students continue with their jobs alongside upgrading their skillsets and adding an 'MBA' tag to their profiles.
A:
Executive MBA


Q: How is a Part-time MBA better in comparison to the full-time MBA/Executive MBA or Distance MBA programs?
While a full-time program would require 100% involvement and most of the programs and residential ones. On the other hand, programs are offered in an online mode wherein direct communication with the faculty members or fellow students. The Part-Time MBA module takes care of both these aspects. Not only is the program more affordable, but it also allows one to imbibe the learnings in a classroom environment which is offered in a pedagogy which is a mix of traditional and modern methods. This mode also enables students to interact with the professors, guest lecturers from industries and fellow students during or after the classes.
A:
Distance MBA


Q: What is the duration of Part-time MBA?
The duration of Part-time MBA is flexible. Students can complete the programme as per their convenience and capabilities within three to five years. Each institute has its specific duration and some of them also allow students to take an extension to complete the program. This is the flexibility offered by the institutes to the Part-time MBA students since they are pursuing the program while continuing with their jobs.
A:


Q: Is the curriculum of Part-time MBA as rigorous as a full-time MBA?
As compared to the full-time Executive MBA program, the rigour is much lesser in a Part-time MBA. The curriculum or the course design is much more flexible to give the students give the breather to efficiently balance their jobs as well as studies. Since the classes are conducted in the evenings or weekends, students can prepare their schedule to study or complete assignments without hampering their professional responsibilities.
A:


Q: Shall I opt for a specialized Part-time MBA or a generic one?
This is a decision which a student should take based on his/her career aspiration or goal. If s/he aims to work in a particular sector, then it is best to choose a suitable specialization. On the other hand, if the student wants to excel in the present job and get the management lessons on each function to prep up for a leadership role, then a general Part-time MBA would suffice. Moreover, there are several electives to opt for in a general Part-time MBA program as well, which a student can choose based on his/her interest areas.
A:


Q: Is there an age limit for the students interested in pursuing a Part-time MBA program?
Although there is no hard and fast criterion for age limit, some of the institutes do have an age limit criteria, which ranges from 27 years to 50 years.
A:


Q: What kind of industry exposure can a student expect from Part-time MBA courses?
Owing to the course design, there is no scope of industry training or visits. Moreover, since the students are working professionals, they are already aware of the major functions and operations involved in an organization. However, the B-schools do arrange guest lectures from industry experts to provide fresh insights on the best management practices and trends. Moreover, there is ample scope of peer learning from fellow students who come from diverse backgrounds in terms of sectors and functions.
A:


Q: Are placement processes conducted after the completion of the program?
No, the placement process is not conducted by the institutes after the program completion. Since the program is attended by working professionals, who want to take their career at the next level, placement support is not provided by the institutes.
A:


Q: Since there is no placement offered by the institutes, what are the scopes for a student after completing the program?
The scope lies in taking a leap in the existing career or job. If the employee wants to get promoted to a higher managerial post, a Part-time MBA would provide him/her a much-needed push to climb up the corporate ladder. In case he/she wants to change the career path or explore a more challenging leadership role in a different industry type or organization in the same sector, the Part-time MBA would be the roadmap to the new avenue, without having to take a break from the job and suspending the earning. Some may also like to venture into entrepreneurship after the course completion.
A:


Q: Is a Part-time MBA considered relevant by the industry?
Yes, there is equal acceptance of the Part-time MBA holders as there is for the full-time MBA or Executive MBAs. Moreover, if pursued from one of the top B-schools, the Part-time MBA is aptly valued by the industry. The prior work experience is also considered. Rather than the degree, the companies tend to look at the skillsets, leadership qualities and ability to control a crisis or turn challenges to opportunities of the existing or prospective employees. If one is equipped with these qualities, there would be no hindrance towards reaching his/her goal.
A:


Q: Are the Part-time MBA programs residential in nature?
Since the programs are conducted during evenings or weekends, and the students attend jobs during the day, the scope of Part-time MBA programs being residential is not there. Students visit the campus to attend the classes as per the schedule and need not stay back longer. In case, they need to stay back after class hours for assignments or exams, they may utilize common spaces like the library, reading room, computer labs or cafeteria.

Hi. Yes, you can do MBA after scoring 45% in Graduation. MBA - Master of Business Administration, a two years Post Graduation Course and can be pursed through cracking entrance exam like CAT/MAT/XAT etc.

Dear Rohit, Here are top MBA specializations that will strike the chord of an MBA aspirant 1- MBA in Business Analytics 2- MBA in HR 3- MBA in Marketing 4- MBA in Finance 5- MBA in Entrepreneurship 6- MBA in Insurance &amp; Risk Management 7- MBA in Operation Management 8- MBA in Logistics Management The student should have the right focus and attitude to decide the career goals and work specializations. Also consider the return on investment that the course promises. This in turn depends on rankings, acceptance rate, faculty, academic culture and career services associated with the chosen institute at, IILM University, Gurugram have freedom to choose electives from more than one domain as well. This will help you to take a balanced decision. Also one must give equal importance to all the aspects of management because when you climb up the corporate ladder, you are required to perform more than one function and thus the knowledge of different areas come into play. Hope this help!
