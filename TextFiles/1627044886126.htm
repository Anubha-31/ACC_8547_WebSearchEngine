Further, as a Research Student one needs to give at least two seminar presentations as part of their tenure as a Research Scholar and thereafter submit a Certificate in the prescribed format to the Research Unit.
Next, PhD students need to publish at least one research paper in a peer reviewed/refereed Journal and also submit a Certificate in the prescribed format to the Research Unit before they submit their PhD thesis.
Before aspirants submit their thesis, their supervisor or guide will organise a Pre-submission Seminar. This seminar will be open to all. As part of this seminar a report will be submitted which will include suggestions for improvement and the supervisor would ensure that candidates incorporate all these suggestions in the final thesis.
Candidates then need to incorporate all the changes and submit a summary of their thesis to their supervisor or guide at least 45 days before the submission of the thesis.
Finally, candidates need to submit their thesis in hard copy as well as soft copy. This thesis will be examined by external experts. In case any expert suggests any modifications in the research paper submitted by the candidate then he/ she needs to re-submit a modified thesis.
Next, a viva-voce is conducted wherein candidates can openly defend their thesis and present their point of view before a panel of experts.
Candidates who complete all these steps to perfection would only be conferred a PhD degree.

Hello Rishu, it's indeed great to know that you are interested in doing your PG and doctorate inspite of having completed your graduation eight years ago. Unfortunately professional courses are not available by correspondence and you need to take admission and physically attend classes. This you can do only if there is college offering PG in part time or evening classes mode. I am afraid this information is not available on net and you will have to ring up each college where you live to find status. Alternatively you can think of pursuing any other course by distance mode. Just download brochure cum application form of IGNOU. There are plenty of courses that you can do. Best wishes to you.

Hi. Keep one thing clear in your mind, just like, Ph.D. is not for everyone, in the same manner having a, Ph.D. degree behind your name does not make you super smart or super cool or super talented and also it is not the scale of success.

Hi. Keep one thing clear in your mind, just like, Ph.D. is not for everyone, in the same manner having a, Ph.D. degree behind your name does not make you super smart or super cool or super talented and also it is not the scale of success. During those working years, you study on your own research papers, talk to people who have left industry and went to academia, talk with professors if possible, do some research on your own and SEE if you really like to do it or not. This will be kind of training your mind and test if really you want it from your heart and soul to commit 4 to 5 years of your valuable life in doing research and get this degree, which may or may not give you the desired results which you hoped for when you began.

Hi. PGDM is generally not allowed as an eligibility for Ph.D. admission. However if your PGDM is equivalent to MBA as per the AIU (Association of Indian Universities) norms then you can be admitted as a Ph.D. student. You need to check your Certificate and Institute from which you did your PGDM.

Hello Ritesh More, it is very nice to hear from you that you are interested in doing some research work after completion of your b e and MBA. But I am afraid. A student can seek admission for doctoral research in a subject in which he / she has completed post graduation studies. In your case you have shifted from engineering to management and hence many universities may not accept your candidature for doctoral research. Be that as it may you can definitely seek admission for doctoral research in any of the management subjects. You can perhaps try PG + doctoral research programme perhaps offered by deemed to be universities. Best wishes to you.
