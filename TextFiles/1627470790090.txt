What is Electrical Engineering?



Electrical Engineering is that branch of Engineering which deals with the study of application of electricity, electronics and electromagnetism. Trained electrical engineers design electric circuits and equipment. They work on large power plants as well in small hardware companies which includes designing, manufacturing and operating power plants, industrial machinery, electrical motors, computer chips and ignition systems for automobiles, aircrafts, space crafts and all kinds of engines.




Electrical Engineering is spread across a range of specialties such as acoustics, speech, signal processing to electromagnetic compatibility, automobiles to vehicular technology, geo-science and remote sensing, laser and electro-optics, robotics, ultra-sonic, ferroelectrics and frequency control.
A qualified electrical engineer has the option to choose his/her line of work from a range of areas like computers, cell phone, electronic gadgets, radars, navigation systems, power plant, etc. Average starting salary of fresh electrical engineering graduates is Rs 4 lakh and upwards.
Electrical Engineering: Eligibility Criteria and Entrance Exams
Candidates can pursue Electrical Engineering at both graduate and postgraduate level. Below mentioned are the eligibility criteria to be fulfilled in order to pursue Electrical Engineering:


Minimum eligibility criteria to pursue Electrical Engineering (BTech) is class 12 pass in PCM/PCMB subjects with at least 50% marks in aggregate from a recognized school or university or equivalent

To pursue Electrical Engineering at post graduate level, the candidate must have a BTech degree in electrical engineering

Electrical Engineering Entrance Exams:

Electrical Engineering in Chandigarh University, Mohali is really Good. Electrical Engineering as a career and field of study has a high scope in India even beyond what is examined. It is a field that drives every other one since its application in electricity is the power behind all forms of industry either small or well established one. It will ever continue to grow as time passes. Electrical engineering generally deals with the generation of electricity, the transmission and the distribution to the consumers. Electrical Engineers in India can secure jobs in power distribution companies, power plants, railways, metro rails, the aviation sector, manufacturing sector and various government organizations. With a NAAC A+ graded institute, and a very high rate of development, one can catch the heights of the sky and space. CUCET 2021 also offers up to 100 percent scholarships for all its UG and PG courses. Thanks good luck!

Hello M Vinay. I can understand your angst and anxiety. For all purposes Diploma is considered as equivalent to 12thand hence you are definitely eligible to appear for AFCAT. Where ever they talk of 12th, you assume it to be for Diploma. Fill up the form and don't worry. Best wishes to you.

Hello Pradip, yes why not? Perhaps if you had given some more details about yourself like from where you have done your 10th, which is the minimum eligibility for getting admission in a Diploma course and also the place where you belong to some relevant advise could have been given. From your surname it looks like that you are from Maharashtra. The state government has not yet announced how the students are going to be given marks for 10 standard. This is quite crucial for you since admissions for Diploma are dependent on the marks obtained in 10th. In view of this I would advise you to have some patience and keep observing the news on TV or the newspapers about the Maharashtra governments decision on marking scheme for the students of 10th. Once this is announced, Director of technical Education of the state government will declare the procedure for students to apply for admission in Diploma courses across the state. Best wishes to you.

Hello Harmit Singh Dhanda, it's very nice to hear from you that you are interested in pursuing you are graduation in engineering after completion of your Diploma in engineering. You have also stated that you want to do it in a part time mode. By this I assume that you are working somewhere and hence are not able to devote full time and three years for completion of degree. In such a condition you need to find a college in a place where you are employed or where you are living which is offering the facility of part time engineering course and then seek from them the procedure to get a seat in their college in this part time course. Unfortunately such information are not available online or else I would have sent you the link for this. Best wishes to you.
