GATE CS 2021 (Revised) Syllabus




Difficulty Level :

Medium

Last Updated :
03 Jul, 2021

IIT Bombay is organizing GATE 2021. In this year, and has also revised the syllabus of various GATE Papers.
The GATE authority 2021 has made major changes





GATE CS 2022 TS
For the CSE (Computer Science and Information Technology) paper, GATE authority has revised syllabus, we have compare syllabus of GATE CS 2020 and GATE CS 2021 and found these following changes.
Though, they have completely updated Syllabus for General Aptitude (GA) and added two more topics : “Analytical Aptitude”, and “Spatial Aptitude”.
There are following changes for :
Technical part of CSE






Syllabus of General Aptitude (GA) have completely updated and divided into four parts :

Verbal Aptitude
Quantitative Aptitude
Analytical Aptitude
Spatial Aptitude
“Monoids” is added in the Discrete Mathematics, but it was inclusive part of “Groups” in previous syllabus.
“Graph search” updated as “Graph traversals” in the Algorithms.
“pipeline hazards” is added in the Computer Organization and Architecture.
“Local optimisation”, “Data flow analyses: constant propagation, liveness analysis, common subexpression elimination.” is newly added in the Compiler Design.
“System calls” and “I/O scheduling” are clearly added in the Operating System, but these were inclusive in the previous syllbus.
There are major changes in the syllabus of computer networks.

“IPv6”, “Basics of Wi-Fi”, “Network security: authentication, basics of public key and private key cryptography, digital signatures and certificates, firewalls.” are removed.
“CIDR notation, Basics of IP support protocols (ARP, DHCP, ICMP), Network Address Translation (NAT), and Email” are added.
