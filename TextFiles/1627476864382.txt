Some colleges also offer a Diploma in Civil Engineering.

Diploma in Civil Engineering
There are many institutes that offer a two-year diploma course in civil engineering.

Eligibility

The aspirants must have passed class X or its equivalent examination with a minimum of 45% marks each in Science and Mathematics as compulsory subjects. The students must have also studied English as one of the compulsory subjects.

BTech Civil Engineering
It is a four-year full-time undergraduate program divided into 8 semesters.

Eligibility

Aspirants must have passed 10+2 or equivalent examination from any recognized central or state board with Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics as compulsory subjects.
The admission process of the BTech program is done through the entrance exams such as - JEE Main, JEE Advanced, MHCET, KCET and other exams.

MTech in Civil Engineering
It is a two-year full-time post-graduation program.

Eligibility

The students must have passed a BTech degree with a minimum passing percentage in the aggregation of all subjects studied in the undergraduate program.
The admissions are done through the entrance exam such as - GATE score merit list.




Top Entrance Exams for Civil Engineering

Important FAQs on CIvil Engineering

Q. Being a civil engineer, how will the post-graduation specialization in structural design help me to get a good job in Government sector?
A. Structural engineering holds the maximum number of seats in Government services exams. Persons with good command on the subject have a better chance at cracking the exams and to be recruited on senior posts.

Q. I got only 50% in my BE course but scored very good marks in GATE (civil engineering), how will it be beneficial for me?
A. You can go for pursuing MTech degree in IITs or NITs. These institutes have different selection criteria and some of them also consider under-graduation scores.
As far as PSUs are concerned, there is very less scope for civil engineers. The interview calls are solely based on a candidate’s GATE rank. Some PSUs also conduct their separate exams after the interview. They also check for a candidate’s BE aggregate.

Q. What are some journals publishing recent research in civil engineering?
A. Following is the list of few international journals related to civil engineering:

International Journal of Civil Engineering
Journal of Civil Engineering and Architecture-David Publishing Company
Civil Engineering and Architecture

Q. I am a 2nd-year civil engineering student. Where should I go for training? Is it necessary to go for training?
A. The need for training depends on the plans for the kind of profession you want to choose in future. It would be very helpful for a field job. Civil engineering can only be learnt completely on the field by observing how things work. For a career in consultancy and design structures, field training will also be very helpful. You should go for a training.

Q. As a future civil engineer, which foreign language would be beneficial for me?
A. It depends on the nation you'd be going after completing the graduation. The country’s language where you'll be posted help you to do internships and get project works.

Q. What are the top companies to pursue an internship in India?
A. The choice company for internships majorly depends on the sector you want to join after completing your course. Following is the list of some top companies of different sectors related to civil engineering:

Structural Engineering/Geo-technical Engineering:

Indian Railways
Public Works Department
Real Estate Companies

Transportation Engineering:

National Highway Authority of India
Public Works Department
Airport Authority of India

Environmental Engineering:

Public Health Department
Municipal Committee of any city

Building Materials:

H&R Johnson Tiles
Townships/Real Estate Developers

Q. What should I choose after completion of a bachelor’s degree in civil engineering, post-graduation or job?
A. Civil engineering degree holders can go for various advance courses in Drafting and Design, Structural Design and Surveying. They can also go for a job in the sector. Whatever candidates choose the job or higher education depends on their interests. However, job options are better after a postgraduate degree.

Q. What do the civil engineers will do?

Hello!! Being an alumni of LPU I would like to throw some light on the specific program outcomes of CIVIL ENGINNERING: 1: Creating Civil Engineers who are competent enough to deal with real life problems and providing their sustainable solutions through knowledge of mathematics, science and engineering, including project based learning and industry internship. 2 : Imparting knowledge of latest technology and development in the field of Civil Engineering through updated curriculum and its content, incorporating software learning, E learning, practical learning. 3 : Skill development, both technical as well as soft skills, to make them ready to work in industry or as an entrepreneur, in its own domain or in multidisciplinary domain to achieve the desired outcome. 4 : Inculcate a culture of lifelong learning through continuous updation and improvement in their knowledge domain and enhancing the professional benchmarking. 5 : Build civil engineers who have a sense of social responsibility and deep understanding of professional knowledge and ethics in discharging their duties with right decision making at appropriate time to increase productivity and effectiveness. I would like to flourish some the facts &amp; figures about this course running by LPU. 1.In LPU Civil Engineering is treated as an Engineering programme which articulates the concepts from basic science to technology through lab practices and projects to gain knowledge in areas like Structural, Environmental &amp; Highway Engineering, Construction Management etc which are in sync with industry requirements. 2.School of Civil Engineering offers Contemporary Curriculum, Professional Enhancement, Industry Immersion, Domestic &amp; International Projects, Regular Industrial Visit, Interdisciplinary Minors, Innovative Pedagogy. 3.LPU is having Tie Ups with Civil Industry which resulted into Content Delivery by Industry Experts, Projects in collaboration with Industry. 4.School has 1000+ number of students who are involved in different research trials throughout the year. 5.PEP (Professional Enhancement Program) classes used to be held every year for all the students from the very first semester to prepare the student Industry ready from Day 1. This program not only increases the employability of the students but also develop their personality in terms of their social life. 6.Huge diversity of Student Both National &amp; International (FROM 28 STATES &amp; 40+ COUNTRIES).

Hello Gowthami, different countries have different criteria for admission to undergraduate courses including for engineering courses. In addition, admissions are not based exclusively on academic performance but are based on many other parameters also. In view of this I would strongly recommend that you should approach an agency dealing with sending students abroad for undergraduate studies. This is so since they would be aware of different parameters that your CV must have for successful attempt at admission. Best wishes to you.

Hello Lavanya, practically speaking civil engineering has almost no similarity with the branch of aeronautical engineering. Therefore I am doubtful as to whether you are eligible to get admission under, atleast, lateral mode in this branch. But I would advise you visit the webpage of the directorate of technical education of your state to find out which branches of engineering a student can get under lateral mode of admission after completing Diploma in different branches. However you can treat this Diploma as equivalent to 12th and then appear for the entrance examination conducted by your state for admissions to engineering colleges and then definitely you can seek admission in the first year of engineering in the aeronautical branch. Best wishes to you.

A student can seek admission for doctoral research in a subject in which he / she has completed post graduation studies. In your case you have shifted from engineering to management and hence many universities may not accept your candidature for doctoral research.

Hello Jasim Mir, I am afraid that your quest for distance education mode for doing your diploma will not take you anywhere.
