You will have a great research life at IIT Kharagpur.

Placements:
PhD deals with research in some particular areas of interest. You have to do intense research and publish technical papers. For PhD, the probability of getting direct recruitment through campus placements is less compared to other courses. You have to apply for jobs offline, mostly in the R&D department or to various colleges. Still, about 50% of the students are pursuing PhD to get jobs direct through campus placements. The salary package got by one of my friends was 30 LPA in Intel company. I ...

The highest package offered is 30 LPA, the lowest package is 10 LPA, and the average package is 16 LPA. The top recruiting companies are Texas Instruments and Intel. The percentage of students who got internships is 90%. The top roles offered are software engineer and electrical engineer.

Infrastructure:
The facilities available in our department are average as the machines are a bit outdated and do not function well, but they keep renovating the labs. As the number of students available in the courses is high, we are divided into groups of 3-4 students to perform experiments. The hostels in IIT Kharagpur are known as Halls of Residence, as we truly say, IIT Kharagpur is our 2nd home, or home away from home.
