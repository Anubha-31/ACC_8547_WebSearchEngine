TreeMap in Java

Sort an array which contain 1 to n values

Sort 1 to N by swapping adjacent elements

Sort an array containing two types of elements

Sort elements by frequency | Set 1

Sort elements by frequency | Set 2

Sort elements by frequency | Set 4 (Efficient approach using hash)

How to iterate over a TreeMap in Java?




Last Updated :
28 Jun, 2021

Given a , the task is to iterate this TreeMap in Java.
TreeMap
The in Java is used to implement and along with the . We cannot iterate a TreeMap directly using iterators, because TreeMap is not a Collection.
TreeMap
Map interface
NavigableMap
Abstract Class
So we will have to use . This method returns a collection-view(Set<Map.Entry>) of the mappings contained in this treemap. So we can iterate over key-value pair using getKey() and getValue() methods of Map.Entry. This method is most common and should be used if you need both map keys and values in the loop.
TreeMap.entrySet() method
Below is the Java program to demonstrate it.





























// Java program to iterate over a TreeMap



import
java.util.Map;

import
java.util.TreeMap;



class
IterationDemo {


public
static
void
main(String[] arg)


{


Map<String, String> gfg


=
new
TreeMap<String, String>();




// enter name/url pair


gfg.put(
"GFG"
,
"geeksforgeeks.org"
);


gfg.put(
"Practice"
,
"practice.geeksforgeeks.org"
);


gfg.put(
"Code"
,
"code.geeksforgeeks.org"
);


gfg.put(
"Quiz"
,
"quiz.geeksforgeeks.org"
);




// using for-each loop for


// iteration over TreeMap.entrySet()


for
(Map.Entry<String, String>


entry : gfg.entrySet())


System.out.println(


"["
+ entry.getKey()


+
", "
+ entry.getValue() +
"]"
);


}

}









Output:
[Code, code.geeksforgeeks.org]
[GFG, geeksforgeeks.org]
[Practice, practice.geeksforgeeks.org]
[Quiz, quiz.geeksforgeeks.org]
