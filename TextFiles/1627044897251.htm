What is Materials Science?



Materials Science (also referred to as materials science and engineering) is an inter-disciplinary subject that involves the study of all materials starting from a glass or a piece of sport equipment to those used in medicine and aerospace. The subject explores the structure and design of any material and how it can be used in the most optimum way.
Apart from this, the field of materials science also focuses on creation of new materials on the basis of different engineering requirements. The materials created through this field of science are used for a variety of purposes and range from nanotechnology to advanced polymers.
Through their understanding of how materials work, materials scientists or engineers create new materials for new applications and develop existing materials to improve performance.
Materials science is a broad field of study and contains plenty of opportunities for students who wish to build their career in it and its related technologies.


Required Skillset for Materials Science



All candidates looking to build their career in the field of materials science should possess the below-mentioned skillset and traits:





Skillset for Materials Science Candidates


Analytical bent of mind

Problem-solving skills


Organisational skills

Communication skills
