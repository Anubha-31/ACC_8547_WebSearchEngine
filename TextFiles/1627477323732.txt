Success Stories






Pamir Roy
Student, North Eastern Regional Institute of Science and Technology
Basically I don't see much of a difference between regular classes and online learning. I look at online learning as new way of the 21st century NPTEL courses are enhancing learning thru technology. The Discussion forum has been a great help as most questions that I had already been discussed there.

Suresh Chandra HS
QUEST, Bangalore
I am a Director at QUEST, in Bangalore and at 53+, am thrilled at my "academic" performance. Truly, the grey-cells are still active! I have a Bachelors degree in Electronics(RVCE-Bangalore) and a Masters in Telecommunications and Software Engineering from BITS, Pilani. I have worked on Alcatel, Motorola and Cisco projects as a senior Project Manager. This is turning out to be an amazing learning experience for me at 53+ ! I have 15 NPTEL Certifications,as on date. I have a passion for life-long learning !
