Placements:
One thing that stands out in this college is its placements. Approximately all the students get placed via campus placements. The average package offered for CSE is 26 LPA, and that for ECE is 17 LPA. The lowest package is 7 LPA for both. Whether you are from CSE or ECE, you get very good exposure to coding. Coding culture is the best in the country.

Infrastructure:
The labs are the best in India. It's best for research in CS. Labs are set up by big companies that encourage young talents. It has a robust researc...

The college has its own incubation cell and the famous T-Hub which promotes students ideas.

Placements:
Around 95% of the total college students were placed, with a median package of 21 lakh per annum and the lowest package of around 4 lakh. Since the course is a research based course, the duration depends on how fast the thesis is submitted and approved. From the passing out batch of my course, around 75% of them have sat for placements and have a 100% acceptance rate, while the remaining 25% have pursued higher studies (PhD). The college does not recommend research students to do internships sin...

Overall the academics of the college is excellent if one is interested in studying.

Placements:
The course B.Tech in CS with MS in human sciences by research started with my batch only. So we don't have any concrete data about placements but a somewhat similar course to ours EHD had 100% placements in the past years, with some of the seniors with excellent jobs.

Infrastructure:
LAN is available to all the students except first years, medical facilities are not good, there is no ambulance for emergencies, food is above average as we have four messes with option to eat in any. The sports facilities are avera...

It has an amazing hostel and food, excellent placements every year and really good infrastructure.

Placements:
Our course CHD is a new one which has started in the previous year only. However, it derives somewhat from the EHD course which was available in IIITH and was stopped 5 years ago. I feel pleasure to study on the campus in the last batch of EHD, and the previous batch just passed out this year. So, placements are still pending. Most of them have been offered PPOs, but the placements have been good for the batches previous to that batch.

Infrastructure:
Our college has excellent infrastructure, and the entire building called Nilgiri is allotted for labs. Moreover, another building called KCIS is dedicated to research. Along with that, there are two more buildings for teaching, tutorials, etc. The food served is amazing, and there are 4 messes. Every mess serves a different cuisine. Hostels are clean, and there are services for cleaning, security, etc. Canteens here are famous, and they surely serve good food. As far as sports and games are cons...

Review of IIIT Hyderabad - International Institute of Information Technology.

Placements:
Almost 100% of the students from our course got placed. The average salary package offered was 15 LPA. About 50% of the students got internships. Top recruiters for our course are Microsoft, Amazon, Goldman Sachs, Google, App Dynamics, Apple, Nvidia, Samsung, Walmart, Adobe, etc. Roles offered here are a data scientist, software developer and front-end and back-end developers.

Infrastructure:
The infrastructure provided for our course include Wi-Fi facility, which is available only in academic block, classrooms and library but not in hostels. Ethernet facility is available in the hostels. There are 4 messes with different food menus, and they are repeated weekly. Non-vegetarian is also available on 2-3 days in a particular mess. There are 3 main canteens with food and all types of juice facilities, and there are also a few stalls for other food items. Sports are not much good, but ta...

Most students get placed in reputed companies like Google, Facebook Amazon, Microsoft, etc. The college conducted a placement drive, and all students were placed through that drive. The salary packages offered were much higher than any other colleges in India. Placement is one of the salient points of IIITH.

But, the only disadvantage is, the college charges 8% of the basic salary from the company, and because of that, a lot of start-ups are not able to offer placements to the students in our college.
