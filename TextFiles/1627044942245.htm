Hello Shashi Raj, it is perhaps not correct to say that there are no eligibility criteria for admission to medical or engineering this year. Almost all the boards in the country would be releasing results of the 12th standard shortly, with students getting marks list with marks also. What has changed this year is the method of evaluation. These marks will be for the student in his or her future life. Even the entrance exams for medical as well as engineering colleges are going to be conducted by different authorities in the times to come. Best wishes to you.
