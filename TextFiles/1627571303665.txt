CBSE Class 9 Maths Notes




Last Updated :
27 May, 2021

CBSE Class 9 Mathematics Concepts, makes students to understand all the concepts of class 9 maths chapter-wise as it covers all the topics and subtopics provided in the syllabus of class 9 maths. GeeksforGeeks provided the following chapter-wise notes that contain numbers of theorems with their proper explanations, formulae with their applications, and graphs that need to accelerate students’ knack of practicing problems and boost their interest to pursue maths in higher classes.





Chapter 1: Number Systems
The numeral or number system is the combination of natural, integers, rational, irrational, and real numbers. This lesson covers the entire concepts of the numeral system and its types, representation on the number line, laws of rational exponents, and integral powers.


Number System

Decimal Expansion of Real Numbers

Operations on Real numbers

Laws of exponents for real numbers

nth roots of a number



Chapter 2: Polynomials
Polynomial is an expression that comprises variables and coefficients which involves the operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponentiation of variables.







Polynomials in One Variable

Zeroes of a polynomial

Remainder Theorem

Multiplying Polynomials

Algebraic Identities of Polynomials

Standard Algebraic Identities



Chapter 3: Coordinate Geometry
The coordinate geometry is a part of geometry where the position of the points on the plane is described with the help of an ordered pair of numbers called coordinates.


Cartesian Coordinate System

Cartesian Plane



Chapter 4: Linear Equations in Two Variables
Any equation which can be defined in the form ax + by + c = 0, where a, b and c are real numbers, and a and b are not both zero, is called a linear equation in two variables.


Linear Equations and their solutions

Graph of a linear equation in two variables

Equations of Lines Parallel to the x-axis and y-axis



Chapter 5: Introduction to Euclid’s Geometry
Euclidean geometry is the branch of geometry that deals with the study of geometrical shapes and figures based on different axioms and theorems. This study basically provides a brief explanation for flat surfaces.


Euclid’s Definitions, Axioms, and Postulates

Equivalent version of Euclid’s Fifth postulate




Chapter 6: Lines and Angles
In geometry, Lines and Angles are defined as figures that are made up of infinite points extending indefinitely in both directions. Lines are straight and have length and breadth, while an angle is a figure from which two rays emerge from a common point.






Basic terms and definitions

Pairs of Angles

Lines parallel to the same line and Angle Sum Property



Chapter 7: Triangles
Geometrically, a triangle is defined as a three-sided polygon consist of three edges and three vertices. The most important and applied property of a triangle is its Angle sum property which means the sum of the internal angles of a triangle is equal to 180 degrees only.


Congruence of Triangles

Properties of triangles

Angle Sum Property of a Triangle

Inequalities in a triangle

Theorem – Angle opposite to equal sides of an isosceles triangle are equal



Chapter 8: Quadrilateral
A quadrilateral is a plane geometrical figure which has four sides and has four corners or vertices. Typically, quadrilaterals are rectangle, square, trapezoid, and kite or irregular and uncharacterized figures with four sides.


Angle sum property of a quadrilateral

Types of quadrilateral

Properties of Parallelograms

MidPoint Theorem

Rhombus

Kite – Quadrilaterals



Chapter 9: Areas of Parallelograms and Triangles
The area of a plane figure is described as the amount of the planar surface covered by a closed geometric figure like rectangle, square, etc. The area of a parallelogram is equal to the product of its


Area of 2D Shapes



Chapter 10: Circles
A circle is a geometrical shape which is defined as the locus of points that moves in a plane so that its distance from a fixed point is always constant. This fixed point is the Centre of the circle while the fixed distance from it is called the radius of the circle.


Circles and its Related Terms

Circle Theorems

Theorem – There is one and only one circle passing through three given non-collinear points

Theorem – The sum of opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral is 180°



Chapter 11: Constructions
Construction helps to understand the approach to construct different types of triangles for different given conditions using a ruler and compass of required measurements.






Basics Construction

Some construction of triangles



Chapter 12: Heron’s Formula
In this chapter, a formula called Heron’s formula is introduced which helps to determine the area of the triangle when three sides of its being given. The application of this formula also helps to find the area of other different polygons also.


Heron’s Formula

Applications of Heron’s Formula



Chapter 13: Surface Areas and Volumes
Surface area and volume are the measures calculated for a three-dimensional geometrical shape like a cube, cuboid, sphere etc. The surface area of any given object is the area occupied by the surface of the object while volume is the amount of space available in an object.


Volumes of Cubes and Cuboids



Chapter 14: Statistics
Statistics is the study of the representation, collection, interpretation, analysis, presentation, and organization of data. In other words, it is a mathematical way to collect, summarize data. The representation of data differently along with the frequency distribution.


Presentation of data

Graphical representation of Data

Bar graphs and Histograms

Central Tendency

Mean, Median, Mode, and Range



Chapter 15: Probability
The Probability in this class includes basic probability theory, which is also used in the probability distribution, to learn the possibility of outcomes for a random experiment and to find the probability of a single event to occur, when the total number of possible outcomes.


Experimental Probability

Empirical Probability
