You should try hard for CLAT with regularity in study and have a few 2-3 more entrance exams. Few other good option could be ISAT, MH-CET, Symbosis SLAT KIIT, ISAT etc. Many good law colleges conduct their own entrance test for LL.B.

You should try hard for CLAT with regularity in study and have a few 2-3 more entrance exams. Few other good option could be ISAT, MH-CET, Symbosis SLAT KIIT, ISAT etc. Many good law colleges conduct their own entrance test for LL.B. After 12th like JGLU, Nirma University, KIIT school of law, Bharti Vidaypeth. Also you will find a decent and good law college in every region where it is okay to puruse law in other case when brand value and ROI is good. Best wishes.
