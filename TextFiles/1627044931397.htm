The college is the best, and I suggest joining the college if your JAM score is up to the mark.

Placements:
Placements are very good, but due to covid, companies are visiting less on the campus. Overall, 53% of the students got placed in our batch of M.Sc. Another aspect of M.Sc is most of the students don't sit for placements as they wish to opt for a PhD. The field where students get a job is the teaching field, and industries hire students with an average salary package of 6 to 7 LPA. Even many faculty members can help you to get a good job in the nearby industries through their reference. Very few...

I liked the course, and the placements were very good in this college.

Placements:
Placements in M.Tech are average as compared to B.Tech. In 2019, around 60-70% of the students got placed. The highest salary package offered in our department is around 43 LPA. Our entire first year was online, so I wasn't able to access any sources of information. Almost every company comes to the college to recruit students. Based on our course, we got companies like IBM, JP Morgan, HCL, Goldman Sachs, Samsung, etc. Internships and placements aren't finished yet, but maybe 20% of the students...

In the year 2020-2021, the placements in NITW were decent (very similar to tier 1 college), despite the global pandemic which hit every sector. Due to the pandemic, online and offline placement drives were held. 2020 was my freshman year, so I am not sure about the highest and lowest packages offered, but the average package offered was around 7-8 LPA.
