I think you should go for PIBM. As per my knowledge, PIBM has unique training methods for PGDM, which align with the latest industry trends. The most famous USP of this college is the corporate relations it has with numerous companies like Deloitte, Dabur, Xanadu Realty, and much more. This gives students enough corporate exposure and the curriculum is also regularly updated.
