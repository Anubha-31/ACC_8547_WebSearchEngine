Review of IIM Indore - Indian Institute of Management.

Placements:
The placement rate was 100% here. This year the entire placement session was conducted in online mode except for few companies which visited the campus. Many firms visited the campus for placements compared to last year. The highest domestic salary package offered was 44 LPA (including stock options). The average salary package can be found on the college website. Apart from all the conventional roles, this year, we saw more product management roles, which were also again one of the most offered...

All things in our college are best, so the college is popular.

Placements:
The percentage of students who get placed is very high from this course. Placements are also very good here, and the course is also very important. Internship opportunities for students are very good because all the students are good in nature and behaviour.

Infrastructure:
Facilities are very good here, but there are also some problems with Wi-Fi, and there will be noise in the library. However, all students always study hard. Medical and games facilities are also good. The food served in the canteen is of good...

IPM in IIM Indore offers the best course which you haven't heard.

Placements:
Almost 100% of the students from our course got placements. The highest salary package offered maybe around 40 LPA, and the lowest salary package offered was 8 LPA. Recruiting companies for our college ranges from Google to small startups. I will give 4 stars out of 5 stars because placements are affected due to COVID-19 pandemic.

Infrastructure:
Hostels are nice here, but there are no air-conditioners. However, they allow coolers, and the speed of the Wi-Fi facility is very fast. The library is good, and the cl...
