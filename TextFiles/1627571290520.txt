jQuery Tutorials
Last Updated: 15-07-2021

jQuery is an open-source JavaScript library that simplifies the interactions between an HTML/CSS document, or more precisely the Document Object Model (DOM), and JavaScript. Elaborating the terms, jQuery simplifies HTML document traversing and manipulation, browser event handling, DOM animations, Ajax interactions, and cross-browser JavaScript development.

Example:
hover()
css()
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
    <script src=
"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js">
    </script>
    
    <script>
        $(document).ready(function() {
            $("h1").hover(function() {
                $(this).css("color", "green");
            }, function() {
                $(this).css("color", "aliceblue");
            });
        });
    </script>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>GeeksforGeeks</h1>
</body>
