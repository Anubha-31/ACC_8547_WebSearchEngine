Hello Rema, Sadly there are not much colleges in india which provides specialisation in automobile engineering, you need to migrate from here if you really want to explore this field. Or you may take mechanical engineering in IIT'S if you getting it, because they provide best in class opportunities for automobile domain. However if you are really inclined towards Automobile Engineering only. Here is the list of colleges you may look forward to. 1) MIT, Manipal 2) VIT Vellore 3) SRM Chennai 4) PSG Coimbatore 5) DSCE Bangalore Wishing you best for future.

Hello Kartik, it's very nice to hear from you that you want to go to Germany to study automotive. As you must be aware, colleges abroad do not give admissions based solely on academic performance but on host of other parameters. In view of this I would like to strongly advise you to approach an agency that is dealing with sending students to Germany for higher studies since they would be knowing different aspects of the process. Best wishes to you.

Yes, Computer Science &amp; Engineering at Chandigarh University makes you ready for the jobs at top-notch companies globally. The placement record here is outstanding and the atmosphere to churn your talents into accolades for the institute is just unquestionable. Engineering at Chandigarh University is setting a benchmark every year that is on a subtle higher inclination. It is the only university to have lodged more than 200 partnerships with foreign universities that are well-reputed and are within top QS rankings. The highest package offered to the students last year at Chandigarh University was 31.7 lac. More than 500 companies including global IT giant such as Google, Microsoft, Deloitte, etc. , and other renowned firms such as Amazon, Wipro, Haier, HP, etc. are frequent recruiters here. The focused approach of the university towards persistent and multidimensional training of students in-line with the industry expectations and establishment of industry-sponsored labs for hands-on-learning has led to a sharp increase in the number of placement offers and record salary packages.
