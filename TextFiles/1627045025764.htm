MBA is a PG course in management studies. MBA course is the most popular course in management studies. MBA course providing career knowledge for candidates in the field of business management, skill, and administration. Candidate in MBA course they have theoretical knowledge as well as practical knowledge too. Eligibility criteria for the MBA course are Graduation in any stream with a 45% aggregate score of under-recognised University. MBA course is a two-year PG course. LL.B. Is a UG-level course in the field of law. LL.B. Deals with the broad study of constitutional law. Eligibility criteria for the LL.B. Are Graduation in any stream with a 50% aggregate score. LL.B. Course is a three-year course. In my opinion, both MBA and LL.B. Are well-known courses. These two courses have excellent career opportunities for the students. If you looking to join MBA and LL.B. Course then Campushunt will help you to get the best college for your higher studies. I suggest Presidency college Bangalore for these courses. Presidency college Bangalore is one of the top three universities in India. Presidency college Bangalore has responsibilities for the students to develop and implement strategies and to help achieve their goals. If you need further help or want to make the entire admission process a lot simpler, get in touch with us at Campushunt. In and we will help you out.

MBA from IIM is the best option but this is very costly and needs about Rs 30 Lacs if wants to studied in India's top Iims like Ahmadabad, Kolkata and Bangalore. The placement opportunities for MBA students are higher in comparison to LL.B. The Iims needs higher CAT scores and excellent academic performance for admission. While average academic performance (Above 60%) and qualifying the DU LL.B. Entrance exam is good enough for getting admission here. So IIM MBA is recommendable here.

Keeping your academic background in consideration, LL.B. Can be the best option for you if done from a reputed Law College. LL.B. Is one of the oldest academic fields in the world is still one of the most sought after even in this age of information technology. If you wants to find some inspiration to pursue an LL.B. Degree, then just recall or read the life history of Margaret Thatcher, Barack Obama, Benazir Bhutto, and Mahatma Gandhi. Certainly, these names need no introduction and one of the common things among them as they were all law graduates. Some may want to take up law as a profession as they want to uphold justice, which is certainly a noble thought and the most commendable. The work of a lawyer is not restricted just to courtrooms, for they are also hired by large corporate organizations as there is frequent need to look in various legal matters. A lawyer may be involved in the protection of life or for the liberty of someone, as a law graduate, you will develop the capabilities that will put you in the thick of many a job profiles. Let us take a look at some of the salient features, as to why an LL.B. Degree will still provide a commendable profession. Here are the 8 benefits of doing LLB 1. Strong Foundation for a Lucrative Career 2. Multiple Career Options 3. Master Critical Thinking and Reasoning Abilities 3. Financial Stability 5. Use and Mold Law for the Benefit of Everyone 6. Prestige and Respect 7. Know Your Rights and Responsibilities 8. Flexible Working Hours The following are the demerits of LL.B. 1. The rigidity of law 2. Conservative Nature 3. Formalism 4. Complexity.
