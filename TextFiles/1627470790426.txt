Hello Bharat Parakhe, after Diploma in engineering a student can seek admission in an engineering college via two methods. Firstly treating Diploma as equivalent to 12th and following the procedure that a 12th pass would follow to get admission. Secondly, via lateral mode of admission meaning directly into the second year of the four year degree course. There is nothing like external admission. However if you are definitely aware about some colleges admitting students like this then please let me know. Best wishes to you.
