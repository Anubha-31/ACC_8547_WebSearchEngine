It is a great chance for MAT giver this year as many good b schools are accepting MAT including PUMBA. Cut off for PUMBA is very high. Your chances for PUMBA are low with this score but neverthless you can try PUMBA and other good b school with this score. Few other good option could be - - NIT - SIMSREE - Tezpur University - LPU - BIMTECH - Symbosis Pune - Balaji Pune - IPE - IISWBM - KIIT - IIHMR ( for Healthcare management) - Christ University While choosing a b school one should consider ROI, brand value, learning quality. If a b school is well known and its median salary is equal or near to fees than it is okay to go for it.

Chandigarh University is one of the best colleges to pursue MBA, their Teaching faculty is Awesome, the two years you spend is totally worth it to become a Professional. Their starting package is around 4l which is pretty less though. Guys I am not trying to promote this college but every college has its own pros and cons. I have listed a few best colleges in Punjab that you might want to check out. Chandigarh University, Gharuan, Mohali Chandigarh Business School, CGC Landran Lovely Professional University, Jalandhar Agricultural University, Punjab Chitkara University, Patiala Bhai Gurdas Group of Institutions Gian Jyoti Group Of Institutes GNA Institute of Management &amp; Technology Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College All of the above mentioned colleges are the top MBA colleges in Punjab, now that's about the colleges in Punjab however the market has become more demanding and MBA pass outs are expected to be more than just Masters, Global leaders is what is expected from you, you are expected to be the best at what you do, only then you can sustain in the business world. For that matter need that level of Expertise and training foundation. Now the next question is how to go about it? You need to look for colleges that have International standards. There are Institutes like SP Jain, IIM, etc. Can truly transform your career with the innovative Pedagogy and top class educational exposure. I can think of a Institute called as Regenesys Institute of Management, they are an International Institute and have presence across many countries luckily they have one branch in Mumbai, their starting package is 10l, they take you Johannesburg for the second year of your course, more over they place you internationally. Sadly for us they don't have any branch in Punjab, but the good news is they have a residential programme, their hostel facilities are awesome. Check out their website.
