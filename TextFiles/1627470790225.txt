What is Electronics Engineering?



Electronics Engineering can be defined as the branch of engineering that utilises electrical components such as semiconductors, transistors, diodes and others to design Electronics circuits, devices, integrated circuits and electronic systems. The engineers typically also design passive electrical components, usually based on printed circuit boards. Electronics engineers also test circuits built using various electrical components such as resistors, capacitors, inductors etc. to achieve a particular functionality.




Electronics Engineering is considered a subfield of . Electronics Engineering subjects include Analog Electronics, Digital Electronics, Embedded Systems, Power Electronics, etc. An academic degree can be acquired from some universities by pursuing electronics engineering courses with a major in Electronics engineering, while other universities use Electrical Engineering as the subject. The term electrical engineer is still used in the academic world to include Electronics engineers.
Electrical Engineering
Differences between Electronics and Electrical Engineering
The fundamental difference between the two branches of engineering is as follows:




Aspects

Electrical Engineering

Electronics Engineering


Circuits

No Processing Capability

Have Processing Capability


Function

Circuits power machines with electricity

Circuits interpret an instruction or a signal


Component Structure

Electrical components are large and use AC voltages

Mostly, electronic components are tiny and work with a single microprocessor
Electronics Engineering Eligibility
that offer Electronics Engineering have a set selection process and admission criteria for different programmes. Take a look at the eligibility criteria below:
Engineering colleges in India

For Diploma Courses:
A candidate must have completed Class 10 or equivalent examination with Mathematics and Science as mandatory subjects to pursue Electronics Engineering diploma.

For Undergraduate Courses:

Students must have passed Class 12 or equivalent exam scoring a minimum of 50% aggregate marks with Physics and Mathematics as compulsory subjects.
Students must have qualified the entrance examination conducted by the universities or institutions to pursue a course in Electronics Engineering.

For Postgraduate Courses:

Candidates must have a bachelor’s degree in the pertinent field and a valid GATE score or any other exam accepted by the institute/university.
Students must have scored a minimum of 60% aggregate marks in their UG degree.
Electronic Engineering Courses
A candidate can choose any of the diploma, UG degree, postgraduate degree and doctoral courses with Electronic Engineering as a stream in India. Details of Electronics Engineering courses offered by various universities and colleges are as follows

: It is a 3-year full-time course that candidates can pursue after passing their Class 10. After completing the diploma with a minimum of 50%aggregate marks, students will be eligible for direct admission to second year UG engineering degree course (BTech).
Diploma Course in Electronic Engineering
A bachelor’s degree course focuses on conceptual learning, theory and applications. BE/BTech in Electronics Engineering will help students to gain extensive technical training essential for industrial work. The duration of the course is of four years.
UG Course (Bachelors of Technology):
: A postgraduate course would help the student to specialize in the field of their interest within electronics engineering and gain industry knowledge. It is a two-year course after completion of graduation.
PG Course (Masters of Technology)

I have recently heard about the Bharti Vidyapeeth College of Engineering, Pune that has excellent faculty and infrastructure, you can go through it as it accepts lateral entry scheme and if you don't want to go far then There is DTU in Delhi that accepts lateral entry scheme.

Electrical Engineering in Chandigarh University, Mohali is really Good. Electrical Engineering as a career and field of study has a high scope in India even beyond what is examined. It is a field that drives every other one since its application in electricity is the power behind all forms of industry either small or well established one. It will ever continue to grow as time passes. Electrical engineering generally deals with the generation of electricity, the transmission and the distribution to the consumers. Electrical Engineers in India can secure jobs in power distribution companies, power plants, railways, metro rails, the aviation sector, manufacturing sector and various government organizations. With a NAAC A+ graded institute, and a very high rate of development, one can catch the heights of the sky and space. CUCET 2021 also offers up to 100 percent scholarships for all its UG and PG courses. Thanks good luck!

Hello Akshata, it's indeed very nice to know that you are already in final year of engineering after completion of your Diploma in engineering. Unfortunately you have not mentioned as to where you have to put your educational details. But in case any company or organisation is seeking to know your marks of 10/12 etc. Then you can use your marks of Diploma as marks of 12th. Okay? Best wishes to you.

Hello M Vinay. I can understand your angst and anxiety. For all purposes Diploma is considered as equivalent to 12thand hence you are definitely eligible to appear for AFCAT. Where ever they talk of 12th, you assume it to be for Diploma. Fill up the form and don't worry. Best wishes to you.
