What is Aerospace Engineering?



Aerospace Engineering is a branch of Engineering that provides skills and knowledge to design, manufacture and maintain spacecrafts, aircrafts, missiles and weapons systems. A large part of Aerospace Engineering consists of Mechanical Engineering covering a wide range of topics, including computer application, structures, mathematics, physics, drafting, electricity, robotics, aeronautics etc. It also covers two aspects of engineering, namely Aeronautical Engineering and Astronomical Engineering.
Aerospace Engineering is considered to among the toughest branches of engineering that has carved its niche among the students. However, once completed this course gives 'wings' to your career taking it to new heights.




Here’s an overview of Aerospace Engineering for aspirants who wish to make a career in this field.
Aerospace Engineering: Required Skill Set
Aerospace Engineering is a highly specialised technical field that requires overall excellence in mathematical, calculative and observational skills. Research in this field takes years to be completed thus, resilience and persistence are important. Here are a few essential qualities/skills you would require to be a successful Aerospace Engineer:




Required Skill Set For Aerospace Engineering


Excellent academic background in Science stream

Strong analytical and mathematical skills


Creativity and innovativeness in product designing

Eye for detail


Ability to work under pressure and for long hours

Scientific acumen


Physical stamina

Ability to work in a team and be able to lead a team
Aerospace Engineering Eligibility Criteria
An Aerospace Engineering aspirant must meet the minimum eligibility criteria to be able to pursue the course. Check the minimum eligibility criteria for Aerospace Engineering below:

Minimum eligibility criteria for pursuing Aerospace Engineering is passing higher secondary or Class 12 with a minimum of 60 per cent marks (55 per cent marks for SC/ST) in Science stream (Physics, Chemistry and Maths)
Aerospace Engineering is most of the degree courses are offered at post-graduate level. For this, the candidate is required to have 60 per cent marks (55 per cent marks for SC/ST) in Bachelor's degree (BE/B Tech or equivalent)
For admission to post-graduate and Doctoral programmes and research, score is required
GATE
Candidates with three-four year degree in Engineering, technical diploma, five-year Architecture, Postgraduates in Mathematics/Science/Statistics/Computer Applications are also eligible to pursue Aerospace Engineering
If one aspires to join National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in the United States (US), they must be informed that NASA recommends a degree in a variety of disciplines, including Biomedical Engineering, Ceramic Engineering, Chemistry, Industrial Engineering, Materials Engineering, Metallurgy, Optical Engineering, and Oceanography. PhD is highly recommended for those who want to join NASA.




Aerospace Engineering Syllabus
The Aerospace Engineering programme is essentially a BTech programme which is spread over four academic years. Any Aerospace Engineering course comprises the following subjects/topics:





Aerospace Engineering: Syllabus


Aerodynamics

Flight Mechanics


Aerospace Propulsion

Incompressible Fluid Mechanics


Aerospace Structural Mechanics

Introduction to Aerospace Engineering


Aircraft Design

Spaceflight Mechanics

Aerospace Engineering Job Profiles
Aerospace Engineers design spacecraft, aircraft, missiles and weapons systems. In addition, they are also responsible for assembling, maintaining and ensuring they function properly at all times. Some specialise in other important equipment such as air guidance systems, guidance control systems, propulsions, etc.
Duties of an Aerospace Engineer include:

Developing new technologies for use in spacecraft, aviation and defense systems
Designing, assembling and testing of aircraft and aerospace products
Examine damage or malfunction in an equipment to find our possible reason and offer solution
Assessing cost and feasibility of new projects proposed to be undertaken
Determining quality standard acceptance criteria for design methods, quality standards, sustainment after delivery, and completion dates
Evaluating that the project or the product meets engineering principles, safety norms, customer requirements and environmental challenges
Manufacturing aircraft and individual components in coordination with the design team.
Aerospace Engineers take on specialised areas of functioning such as software engineering, structural engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical and electronic engineering, for automation and guidance purposes, aerodynamics or propulsion systems.
Aerospace Engineers specialise in two types of Engineering: Aeronautical and Astronomical.
An Aeronautical Engineer works on aircrafts and its components.

How Palak Sharma, yes, it's the best you can think of. Universities in US offer very good education and after graduation there are enough companies and employment opportunities in US. A word of caution. Admissions in US institutions are not based exclusively on academic performance but depends on nany other factors. Hence I would strongly recommend that you should approach an agency that is dealing with sending students to US for undergraduate studies. Best wishes to you.

Aerospace Engineering in Chandigarh University is really Good. Its a place where teachers always ask to do something new beside learning about aerospace. These new outcomes from the pupils of the departments results into Review Papers, Research Papers and Patents. And indeed Aerospace Department holds a good rate of filing patent and publishing papers in its Bachelor course only! Its a place where you can feel that passion of doing aerospace, as your ideas are always welcomed first! And There is a lot more Advantages of the foreign university tie ups for the aerospace only. With a NAAC A+ graded institute, and a very high rate of development, one can catch the heights of the sky and space. CUCET 2021 also offers up to 100 percent scholarships for all its UG and PG courses. The scholarship amount is determined on a merit basis. Aerospace Engineers are generally appointed as Consultants, Thermal Design Engineers, Mechanical Design Engineers, Aerospace Technologist, Aircraft Production Manager, Assistant Technical Officers, Aerospace Design Checker and Graduate Engineer Trainees. An Aerospace Engineer can work in both private and public companies. The degree holders are acquired by many big firms both in India and abroad.

Aerospace Engineering at Chandigarh University (CU) is equipped with state of art labs. The first experience of flight is provided on flight simulator available only at CU in North India. To understand the working operation and basics of Aerospace Engineering Cessna aircraft is placed in the Hangar. Aeromodelling Laboratory enables students to put their dreams into reality. Essential software for Aerospace Engineering are available to validate the proven theory. Numerous volumes of books authored by foreigners as well as reputed authors from India are available in the Libraries. Certainly I suggest giving first preference to Chandigarh University.

Most Important: Most of the reviews about Chandigarh University (CU) is written by college online it cell itself on various sites by using fake ids. So be very careful and real the condition below carefully. * I guess you must be the same student as I was 1 year ago desperately searching for a good college as it is one of the important factors for a good and decent future and in the way of searching this good college I came to know about a university that promised to fulfill every demand that my better and decent future was demanding. So I called them and asked every question my mind was full of but a strange thing happened while cutting the call last line CU representative told me was there are just 4 seats left. So you will have to decide within next 10 minutes. Strange ! Now I have to decide my whole future in just 10 minutes. I was already too exhausted searching colleges for me. So in hurry or in pressure that they created for me, I got trapped in there plan and took admission here. And then the real game begun, at first every thing was like paradise. Every wish of new Students were fulfilled like we are god or modi :p and all that because they thought that if we will treat them good then they might call their friends for admission but as soon as time passed and all classes gets started (which happened till last of october) they started showing their colors. In just 5 months everything changed. Food Became the worst. Teaching (leave it, you will cry if I will write about it) Internet (They claim they have full campus, if this is true, then I guess I am living outside campus from last year because I haven't seen open Wi-Fi anywhere in campus. ). .
