Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

Q: Is physiotherapy difficult to study?
A: Physiotherapy is an easy topic to understand. However, one must have a thorough understanding of the subjects/topics. If you understand the fundamentals (as in any other subject), you can simply apply your knowledge to find the answers. The first two years are crucial for laying a solid foundation. The third and fourth years are mostly clinical, with a focus on putting what you've learned so far into practise.

Q: Is physiotherapy a good profession to pursue?
A: For science students who want to work in the medical field, physiotherapy is a lucrative career choice. Physiotherapists' starting pay varies depending on where they work. In this specialty, a good physiotherapist with solid knowledge and experience will earn a good living.

Q: Are physiotherapists in demand?
A: Due to post-Covid recovery needs, an ageing and longer working population, population growth, increasing numbers of people with multiple long-term illnesses, and improved survival rates following stroke, trauma, and cancer, there is a rising need for physiotherapy.

Q: B Pharmacy or physiotherapy, which course is better?
A: If you want to study medicine and research drugs, go for B.pharma, and if you want to study physiotherapy, go for this. Choosing a path, as you can see, is entirely dependent on your interests. Both fields are diametrically opposed. A B.Pharma graduate works with drugs and drug research, while a physiotherapist works with patients who have muscular dysfunction. As a result, both careers have a lot of potential in the future.

Q: What subjects are required for physiotherapy?
A: Eligibility Criteria for Physiotherapy Graduation Programs: To qualify for BPT programme, the aspirant must have completed class 12 with at least 50 percent of your subjects being Physics, Chemistry, and Biology.

Q: How many types of physiotherapy are there?
A: There are four types of Physiotherapy one should be aware of


Geriatric Physical Therapy.
Sports Physical Therapy.
Orthopedic Physiotherapy.
Pediatric Physical Therapy.

Q: Is Neet required for BPT?
A: BPT does not require NEET scores. This course is assessed separately by universities or colleges, but some states, such as Maharashtra, can consider neet scores for admission.
