What is Pharmacy?



Pharmacy is not just about a drugstore. Those who study pharma degree or pharma diploma courses can also choose research and development of medicine as a career option.
A drug/medicine before being prescribed by a doctor has to undergo tests and approvals. It is tested in a lab, studied for dosage and side effects, only then prescription guidelines are formed. The medicines then undergo clinical trials and only when after studying all the possible effects of the medicine, it is introduced in the market. Pharmacists are a part of the entire process. They are also responsible for introducing a new drug/ medicine to various medical practitioners.




The role of a pharmacist does not end here. They study and keep track of all medicines and products with market surveys by connecting with a medical practitioner and distributors for any side effects, reactions, and allergies, etc. Although, before distribution in a market the medicines are tested in labs because of the complexity and diversity of human beings, different outcomes from the same medicine can occur, therefore, a pharmacy practitioner has to research and develop medicines and prescriptions at multitudes. Pharmacy basically includes everything related to your wellness right from the food you consume to the cosmetics, lifestyle products, health, and chemical products that you use.
Looking at the scope of Pharmacy in the healthcare industry, a survey report called ‘Pharmacy at a glance 2015-2017 by International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP), community pharmacy is the largest contributor with 75.1 percent registered pharmacists employed followed by hospital pharmacy with 13.2 percent. The services provided by pharmacy practitioners include:
Reviewing medicines, medicines for hypertension management, directly observed treatments, short courses based medicines, medication reconciliation and new drug development.
Improving the use of medicines:
This includes compounding medicines (based on prescriptions by medical practitioners) and assembling expired medicines from a market.
Product-focused services:
This includes promoting health initiatives, vaccinations, health camps, and other health-related awareness.
Public health services:
World Health Organization (WHO) in India is aiming to strengthen the pharmaceutical sector, including drug regulations, volume, and trade, to facilitate the pharmaceuticals in becoming crucial for India’s growth. The WHO in close association with the Government of India controls the strengths and collaborations for improving the pharmaceutical sector.
For making WHO 2030 Sustainable Development agenda a success, access to medicines is a critical factor. Thus, WHO India’s key strategy is to strengthen the Regulatory system that can help access to quality, safe, effective, and inexpensive medical products in an unbiased manner.
Moreover, WHO India is also effectively working on establishing pharmacovigilance systems by integrating public health programmes, promoting rational drug use initiatives for a medical product in accordance with National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance as well as strengthening procurement and supply chain management.

Hello ShaikSohail, I can understand your angst and anxiety if you are not interested in doing this course. But why? There are great opportunities in pharmacy. It's perhaps much better than engineering where almost 50% of fresh graduates are not able to get jobs. But still if you desire, you have to college some plausible reason and then get TC and your original certs. Best wishes to you.

You can do full time MBA in distance/ regular mode to enhance management knowledge. You can also do short term certification or Diploma in management to equip yourself with basic management concepts before PGPX. I suggest 1 year PGPX from IIM, XLRI, TISS PGDHQM, BITS Pilani, FMS, IIHMR.

You are asking for huge amount of data which perhaps is outside the scope of this. You can seek guidance from the counselors but as your name suggest that you also can find out the data if you just google what you wanted. Counselors are there to guide you if you have difficulty in understanding something or conflict in some of your thoughts. For finding out data you must use Google to the best advantage. Best wishes to you.
