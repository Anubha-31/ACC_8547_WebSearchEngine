Review of IIT Madras - Indian Institute of Technology.

Placements:
More than 70% of the students got placed, and many students opt for higher studies. The highest salary package offered is around 30 LPA, and the lowest salary package offered is 6 LPA. Companies on the first day of placement are the top esteemed companies, namely Airbus, SpiceJet, Air India and many others. Almost 100% of the students got internships from the current passing out batch as it is mandatory for students to get internships in IITM before the start of the 7th semester. Students got ro...

It is the best college to gain lot of knowledge in every field.

Placements:
Our college has good reputation. Most of the students easily get placed from IITs. From IIT Madras, students also get placed in non-core jobs. Almost every student started to prepare for non-core jobs as a good number of companies are offering jobs in IT sectors. Core placements are less than non-core placements.

Infrastructure:
Facilities and infrastructure of our college are topmost. The hostel has many facilities like indoor-outdoor games and music equipment spereratly for each hostel. Wi-Fi is available with...

Review of IIT Madras - Indian Institute of Technology.

Placements:
Almost 86% of the students got placed, and the rest either went for higher studies or were not placed. The highest salary package offered is 24 LPA, and the lowest salary package offered is 5 LPA. Larsen & Toubro is the top recruiter for core branches, and Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Amazon, etc., are the top recruiters for non-core branches. Almost everyone got an internship. Top roles offered to the students are civil engineer, software engineer and machine learning engineer.

You will have a really good campus life and good placements here.

Placements:
The placement scenario is amazing here, even in this COVID-19 pandemic time. Our branch ranks third in campus placements, while CS is the first and EE is in the second position. The average salary package offered for our branch was 15 LPA in 2019-2020. We get compulsory internships which are mostly paid. There are non-paid internships also.

Infrastructure:
The hostel facility is good enough here, and first-year students mostly get double or triple sharing rooms. Later, they will get single rooms. Rooms are not m...

Infrastructure:
It's the best if you don't want to go for any other field except studies. The college has awesome faculty. It has the atmosphere for your mental growth, and it provides you with many chances for your career. E...

There is a good infrastructure on the campus, and there are good faculty members.

Placements:
Our college should provide more core companies for every branch for placements. Students should be encouraged from the beginning of their course for placements. Hardly 1 student gets a chance to get placed in a core company. The average salary package offered was hardly 6 LPA. Companies shouldn't even enrol in campus placements if they offer low salary packages.

Infrastructure:
In terms of providing facilities, it is the best campus. Wi-Fi facility should be provided on the entire campus, which is still not avai...

It was an amazing college. The best experience, students could get in life.

Placements:
Almost 90% to 95% of the students got placed from our batch. Students who ever didn't get placed had not attended for the placements and opted for higher studies. The lowest salary package offered was 9 LPA, and the highest salary package offered was above 30 LPA. Top recruiting companies of our college were Google, Flipkart and Quantitative Brokers. Around 80% to 85% of the students got internships. Top roles offered were management and data science.

Infrastructure:
Classrooms in our college were average and needed renovation. Wi-Fi facility was not available in our college. However, the library was good, which was a peaceful place for doing a lot of things. Facilities in the hostel were good, but there was no Wi-Fi facility. However, LAN speed was great, and the bathrooms were cleaned regularly. The hostel premises were cleanly maintained, and the student-run bodies acted correctly in the hostel. Facilities like a mess, canteen, medical facilities, sports,...

Placements:
About 70% of the students got placed. Companies like Intel, Analog Devices, Cypress Semiconductor, MediaTek and Texas Instruments visit our college for placements. Our college offers top courses like software, VLSI and power electronics, even though few openings for power electronics. It is required from the students to prepare really well for the interviews.

Infrastructure:
It has one of the best academic infrastructures. Since Chennai is unbearably humid and hot, the hostels we stay are not very comfortable. I...

Google Microsoft, TI, GE, Tata motors are some of the top core companies that visited the campus. The placements are not limited to core areas but also non core areas ranging from finance to consultancy.

Infrastructure:
Facilities are the best in the country. All labs were well-equipped. There was unlimited internet connectivity in hostels and departments. Most of the campus has Wi-Fi now. Hostels can be better in terms of room size and cl...

It is one of the best parts of my life, which I would cherish for a lifetime.

Placements:
More than 90% of the students from our course got placed. Remaining students either opted for higher studies or chose other careers like civil services, etc. Most of the companies are open for B.Tech and dual degree both in core and non-core areas. Those companies are JSW, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, American Express, Urban Ladder, etc.

Infrastructure:
In terms of infrastructure, IIT Madras provides you with state of the art equipment and lab facilities to work. These are easily accessible to students round the clock to aid their research works. Hostels are decent with all the necessary facilities. The quality of the food served in the mess is decent with strict hygienic norms, but the taste is not great. However, nutrition standards are checked by authorities. A huge range of sports facilities ranging from gymkhana to tennis court are well ma...

This place won't disappoint you, go for it.

Placements:
As far as the placements for the core disciplines are concerned, chances are bleak as the number of openings are very less and theory of topics right from our first year is expected from to be solid and it is this that they test in the technical rounds of the interview. But for non core, the opportunities are endless.

Infrastructure:
All labs and dept buildings are equipped with state of the art facilities and equipment. Students who wish to pursue research would find ample opportunities. The library has a gigantic collection of books available in physical as well as book and pdf formats. The hostels are pretty old, some being as old as the institute itself. The mess food is satisfactory, it's hygienic and all but shouldn't really expect a high protein meal. A fairly good medical facility is also there. That works almost lik...
