IIT Delhi Biotechnology is an emerging branch.

Placements:
Almost everyone who opts for placement is placed in sectors ranging from core to non-core, from consulting and finances to the technical and analytics. Many students opt for higher studies and most get admissions at top universities in and around the world like the Ivies. The startup culture is also making its way with 4 startups from the 2019 batch of biotechnology alone.
