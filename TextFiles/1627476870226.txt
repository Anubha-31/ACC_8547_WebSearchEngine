Hello Somesh Sen, let me clarify you in simple terms. A Diploma holder can get admission in engineering colleges by two methods. Firstly by means of lateral admission process wherein student gets admission in second year of 4 year degree course. Some states give admissions based on marks in Diploma while others conduct entrance exam called LEET. For JEE Mains and Advanced Diploma is considered as equivalent to 12th and obviously students get admission in first year of 4 year degree course. Best wishes to you.

Hello Raghav Balaji, it's very nice to hear from you that you are interested in preparing deeply for JEE Advanced examination. Fundamentally speaking in this examination, analytical abilities of the students are checked and in this sense one cannot clear the exam merely by repeatedly solving old question answers. Having said this, it is however possible to inculcate this habit by undergoing proper coaching which apparently you are doing. I would say that have a positive attitude and do with conviction whatever you are doing. Best wishes to you.
