It has good culture, great professors and an enormous pool of entrepreneurs.

Placements:
The highest package offered is 17 LPA, and the average package is 8.5 LPA. The top recruiters are L&T and LTI. Most of the students got placed in IT companies. Some got placed in consultancy and finance firms, and some got into core-specific companies. The college has a strong placement unit that stops at nothing to get you placed, provided you have the right skills, which can be easily developed with all the free time you have on campus. Attendance is not compulsory here.

Infrastructure:
The hostels are huge, well-ventilated and provide a sense of belonging. Food is great compared to an average mess, and canteens and food outlets are open till 2 am. We have a football ground, hockey ground, cricket grounds, badminton, table tennis, basketball and squash courts. A gym is also available. There are also numerous clubs and departments ranging from music, dance, classical dances, art and craft, photography, film and media, and a department to maintain and build digital infrastructure...

Review of BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus.

Placements:
In the electronics stream, core sector jobs are less in India, but we have relatively good placements and comparable to NIT. In the IT sector, the placements are comparable to IIT (even old IIT) and NITs. Major recruiting companies are Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Oracle, JP Morgan etc. Our institute provides a practice school program, which is nothing but doing an internship in a company offered by the institute only. The interesting fact is the practice school program is to be taken as a part of...

Placements:
Almost 100% of the students get placed either through summer internship programme (SI), or PS, i.e., practice school in the final year and also through on-campus placements. The on-campus placement season is conducted throughout the year or throughout 12 months, which is not found in most colleges.

Infrastructure:
All the sports courts, be it basketball, tennis, volleyball, etc., are well maintained and periodically undergo a high versed cleaning process. There is a specific area on the campus for the student ac...

Placements:
Around 75% of the students who appeared for placements got placed with the highest package being around 45 LPA offered by Microsoft for nearly 20 students. Average was around 22 LPA. Around 30% had gotten interns and then PPOs and thus had not appeared for placements.

It is a great college with all the basic things needed and good placements.

Placements:
Last year approximately 90% of the students got placed. The remaining 10% of the students went abroad for doing MS. No batch of ECE is yet passed from our college, but we hope to get the highest salary package of approximately 40 LPA. The minimum salary package offered is 12-13 LPA. Top recruiting companies are Intel, Qualcomm, Microsoft, Google, etc.

Infrastructure:
The whole campus has high-speed Wi-Fi and air-conditioners. Classrooms are big and clean, and labs have every necessary equipment. Our college has a very big library, and all books are available. It also has a small digital library inside it. Hostels have small rooms, but the bathrooms are clean. The mess is clean, but the food is average. The campus has medical facilities.

With the help of practice schools which is unique in BITS many have got internship at google, amazon, Facebook etc.

The practice school programme provides internships for every student. Every student has to do internships two times, i.e., in the summer break after the second year for 2 months and in the fourth year for one semester duration. In civil engineering, core roles were offered in the field of design. Some students got pre-placement offers after their internsh...

Review of BITS Pilani - Birla Institute of Technology and Science.

Placements:
Placements here are top-notch. None of the colleges has alumni connections like BITS has which often provides funding like $ 1 million just for research purposes in the college. The median salary package offered in BITS Pilani is more than the median salary package offered in IIT Bombay and is near to the median salary package offered in IIT Delhi. BITS Pilani was among the first few premier colleges which were granted by IoE (Institute of Eminence). So, you do not need to worry about the placem...
