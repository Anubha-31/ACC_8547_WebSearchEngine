Hello Dhruvi Pujara, It's Indeed very nice to hear your ambition of becoming a pilot. Let me explain to you. Pilot's training can begin in a flying School after passing of 12th standard with PCM as the subject combination. There are plenty of flying schools in India which will give you required theoretical training and also mandatory flying training. These flying schools will also help you in obtaining your commercial pilots licence which will enable you to seek employment with any commercial airline. One need not be a graduate to become a pilot. In fact a person of any age can aim to become pilot provided he has right medical fitness. Best wishes to you.

Hello Lavanya, practically speaking civil engineering has almost no similarity with the branch of aeronautical engineering. Therefore I am doubtful as to whether you are eligible to get admission under, atleast, lateral mode in this branch. But I would advise you visit the webpage of the directorate of technical education of your state to find out which branches of engineering a student can get under lateral mode of admission after completing Diploma in different branches. However you can treat this Diploma as equivalent to 12th and then appear for the entrance examination conducted by your state for admissions to engineering colleges and then definitely you can seek admission in the first year of engineering in the aeronautical branch. Best wishes to you.

Aerospace Engineering in Chandigarh University is really Good. The department developed a lot and has more to do and explore with the lab facilities available. Its a place where teachers always ask to do something new beside learning about aerospace. These new outcomes from the pupils of the departments results into Review Papers, Research Papers and Patents. And indeed Aerospace Department holds a good rate of filing patent and publishing papers in its Bachelor course only! Its a place where you can feel that passion of doing aerospace, as your ideas are always welcomed first! And There's a lot more Advantages of the foreign university tie ups for the aerospace only. With a NAAC A+ graded institute, and a very high rate of development, one can catch the heights of the sky and space. Actually aerospace engineering at Chandigarh University is still at developing stage. Teachers are very good and the slaybuss by the PEC is followed. But there is no place of the basics in the slaybuss of tougher subjects like aerodynamics due to which it becomes difficult for teacher to choose weather they complete slaybuss (which is first priority) or teaches the basics to students to make them familier with the subject. This year some companies are coming for the placements of aerospace whcih is really not less that a miracle for aerospace department and this has increased the enthusiasm and faith of students towards the Aerospace Engineering and Chandigarh University.

Aeronautical Engineering comes under the Amity Institute of Technology and it is one of the most interactive courses in Amity University, Mumbai. The programme focuses on building a strong principle about the subject and letting students gain more knowledge through experimenting. With the help of field-experienced faculty members and updated laboratories, students gain insights on the subjects like aerodynamics, propulsion, Thermodynamics aircraft system and instrumentation, mechanics of solids and fluids along with their labs, flight mechanics, aircraft stability and control. Aeronautical engineers work in multidisciplinary engineering teams. They may work in aerospace and aero-engine companies, airline operators, research and development organizations, contract agencies, consultancies, the civil service, the armed forces, government agencies such as the Ministry of Defence. As Batches are getting passout campus placement has seen good arouse year by year good companies are in the campus for in campus interview rather than that university has its own CRC (Corporate resource centre ) Placement cell which is looking after placements, internships and all.
