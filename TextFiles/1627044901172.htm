Hello Nandini Tibrewal, not passing JEE Mains is okay. It only means that you can get admission in NIT or CFTI or IIT. You need to appear for and clear entrance exam mandated by your state to get admission in engineering colleges of your state. You need to clear entrance exam if deemed to be universities if you are interested in getting admission in one of them. Based on the results, you will get branch. You can approach private engineering colleges to get admission in your desired branch, by way of management quota seat also. Best wishes to you.
