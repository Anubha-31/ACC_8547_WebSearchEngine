Programmes Available in Fashion Design 1) B.Sc. (Design - Fashion) 3 years. (6 Semesters) 2) B. Design (Fashion) 4 years. (8 Semesters) Admission in any programme depends on qualifying the Eligibility criteria for the same. Qualifying the same can proceed for Admissions.

Skill Development - High focus on developing design thinking and intensive practical training through exploration of courses like Elements of Design, Design process, illustration, garment construction, design process etc. Live Projects - Hands on experience by working on live projects to develop a sense of problem solving, critical thinking in order to gain real life understanding. Specializations - 3 year course with specialisation in either Design or Merchandising, thus giving an additional advantage of technical career to students whose design skills are not strong. Software Skills - Curriculum is equipped with 21st century digital technologies in design Industry Immersion - Trainings, projects and guest lectures collaborated with industries help to learn from real life situations Live Projects - Hands on experience by working on live projects to develop a sense of problem solving, critical thinking in order to gain real life understanding.
