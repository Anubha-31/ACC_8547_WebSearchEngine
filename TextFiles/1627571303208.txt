CBSE Class 8 Maths Notes




Last Updated :
22 Apr, 2021

Notes for CBSE Class 8 Mathematics Concepts, helps to understand all the concepts of class 8 maths in a chapter-wise manner as it covers all the topics and subtopics provided in the syllabus of class 8 maths. The following chapter-wise notes provided by GeeksforGeeks are equipped with various shortcut techniques and step-by-step methods in order to understand and solve the problems in a better way.





Chapter 1: Rational Numbers
Any number that can be described in p/q form where q is not equal to zero is called a rational number. A rational number is a kind of real number. Or in other words, Any fraction with non-zero denominators is a rational number.


Rational Numbers

Representation of rational numbers on the number line

Rational Numbers Between Two Rational Numbers

Reducing Equations to Simpler Form



Chapter 2: Linear Equations in One Variable
The linear equation in one variable is an expression that is denoted as ax+b = 0, where a and b are any two integers, and x is a variable and consists of only one solution.







Linear Equations in One Variable

Solve Linear Equations with Variable on both Sides

Solving Equations which have Linear Expressions on one Side and Numbers on the other Side

Reducing Equations to Simpler Form



Chapter 3: Understanding Quadrilaterals
Geometrically, a quadrilateral is defined as a closed, 2-D shape that has four linear sides. The different types of quadrilaterals according to their number of edges and vertices are square, rectangle, parallelogram, trapezium, kite, rhombus.


Polygons and its types

Measures of the Exterior Angles of a Polygon

Rectangle, Square, Rhombus, Parallelogram

Some Special Parallelograms



Chapter 4: Practical Geometry
The chapter practical geometry simply means is to construct geometrical figures like squares, triangles, quadrilateral, etc. using a scale, and compass when different parameters of it are known.


Construction of a Quadrilateral



Chapter 5: Data Handling
Data handling refers to the process of collecting, organizing, and presenting any raw information in a way that is helpful to others like in graphs or charts, etc.


Data Handling

Organizing Data

Grouping Data

Pie Chart

Chance and Probability



Chapter 6: Squares and Square Roots
of comethe
Both the concepts
squares and square roots are opposite to each other. As the squares are used for the numbers
after multiplying the number by itself. However,
square root of a number is the value obtained when multiplied by itself to give the original value. For instance, the square of 5 is 25 and the square root of 25 is 5.






Squares and Square Roots



Chapter 7: Cubes and Cube roots
Again bof cubescomethe cube
oth the concepts
and cube roots are opposite to each other. As the cubes are used for the numbers
after multiplying the number by itself thrice. However,
root of a number is the value obtained when multiplied by itself thrice to give the original value. For instance, the cube of 5 is 125 and the cube root of 125 is 5.


Cubes and Cube Roots



Chapter 8: Comparing Quantities
The chapter Comparing quantities is the most basic everyday-life application of Mathematics that deals with quantities. This includes the concepts like percentage, ratio, market price, selling price, cost price, discount and discount price, profit or loss, interest, etc.


Ratios and Percentages

Percent Change & Discounts

Prices Related to Buying and Selling (Profit and Loss)

Compound Interest

Compound Interest Formula

Sales Tax, Value Added Tax, and Goods and Services Tax



Chapter 9: Algebraic Expressions and Identities
The chapter Algebraic Expressions and Identities provides information about the basics of monomials, binomials, and polynomials in an algebraic expression.


Algebraic expressions

Like and Unlike Algebraic Terms

Mathematical Operations on Algebraic Expressions

Types of Polynomials

Multiplying Polynomials

Standard Algebraic Identities



Chapter 10: Visualising Solid Shapes
Visualizing Solid Shapes is a concept that provides the understanding of different solids shapes when visualized in different dimensions and various terms used to describe their properties.


Visualizing Solid Shapes

Mapping Space Around Us



Chapter 11: Mensuration
Mensuration is the chapter that deals with the measurement or the calculations related to determining the area, perimeter, volume of various geometrical figures like square, cube, rectangle, cuboid, cylinder, and triangle, etc.






Introduction to Mensuration

Area of Trapezium

Area of Polygons

Area of General Quadrilateral

Surface Area of Cube, Cuboid, and Cylinder

Volume of Cube, Cuboid, and Cylinder

Volume and Capacity



Chapter 12: Exponents and Powers
The chapter Exponents and powers cover the primary concepts such as laws of exponents and their applications. The chapter deals with the problems using the applications of power to write large numbers in exponents and vice-versa.


Negative Exponents

Laws of Exponents & Use of Exponents to Express Small Numbers in Standard Form



Chapter 13: Direct and Inverse Proportions
This chapter gives a detailed explanation of inverse and direct proportions through problems discussed in two exercises. In which Exercise 13.1 contains a problem to determine the direct proportions between any quantity and Exercise 13.2 deals with the questions from the indirect inverse.


Direct and Inverse Proportions



Chapter 14: Factorization
This chapter comprises the problems on the factors of natural numbers and algebraic expressions, factorization by regrouping terms, factorization using identities, division of algebraic expressions.


Introduction to factorization

Division of Algebraic Expressions



Chapter 15: Introduction to Graphs
This chapter is all about the basic understanding of the graphs, kinds of graphs, etc. Lately, this chapter provided an emphasis on the construction of different types of graphs and their applications.


Introduction to Graphs

Linear Graphs



Chapter 16: Playing with Numbers
All the above-mentioned chapters basically helped to learn about various kinds of numbers and their different properties likewise in this chapter the concept of numbers is discussed in a more general way.


Game of Numbers

Letters for Digits

Divisibility Rules

Playing with Numbers
