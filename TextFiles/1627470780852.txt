Hi. If not well conversant with computers, internet technology, have confusion in navigation tools, it is better to go for paper based MAT exam. Reading skills: There are 200 questions to be answered in 150 minutes in MAT exam. All India Management Association conducts MAT Entrance test in computer-based mode (CBT) & offline (paper-pencil) mode. You can choose to write the exam in either one or both of the modes.

An internship is a short-term work experience offered by companies and other organizations for people usually students. It's basically a great way for students to get involved in the real corporate world & increase practical knowledge to become an industry-ready professional. Some importance of Internship in PGDM program are: STRATEGIC NETWORKING: As an intern, a student will get a chance to work side by side with accomplished industry professionals and get a pretty good idea of what a particular corporate role might entail. Student will not only gain real work experience, but also meet & learn from the pros. And they will start to build their own strategic network, from their fellow interns to seasoned leaders.And those networking will help them to get placed in easily into their desired organizations. INDUSTRIAL EXPOSURE: Although PGDM colleges offers a lot of live projects, case studies & sessions by industry experts but nothing compares to the first-hand experience of working in a corporate office. When a PGDM student gets an internship in a company or industry that they are interested in, they learn something new every day. Right from meeting new people, acquiring new skills, understanding operations to dealing with the real pressure of corporate deadlines they learn so much more beyond their academics which will help them to make themselves industry ready. CHANCE TO GET A PRE-PLACEMENT OFFER (PPO): Many companies use internships as a way to enhance their recruitment efforts. PGDM internship may all time will not guarantee a student for a full-time position however, if a student performs well, there is a good chance that the company will extend him/her a job offer once they graduate. Even if a job offer doesn't happen right away, an intern who makes a favourable impression could receive an offer down the line when an opening occurs on that organization. ENHANCING RESUME: Whether a student is a fresher or not, internships help them greatly to enhance their resume. Students can always mention projects that they were assigned during their internship in their resume. Internship experience makes a college graduate more marketable as they usually require less training & can handle more responsibilities. Getting remunerated financially for work is definitely a success, anyway what an understudy gains regarding exposure is important. So,I feel that money inspires execution, however a learning demeanour will help a student over the long haul. Thank You.

Part time MBA is always preferred for the working professionals as your learning and earning both continued at the same time. And ultimately there is no opportunity loss. However, If anyone wants to do an executive MBA to boost their career and aiming to do from the premium B-Schools like Iims then they can go for it. But here they have to leave their job and ultimately there is opportunity loss equal to your salary.

I partially agree because not only online education but the face to face education is much more beneficial. Also not ignoring that the online education has bought much ease for teachers and students but on other side it has made studnets a bit lazy and unattentive towards their studies. Also the remote areas lack of infrastructure has proven a great challenge for children who are in villages and also living in town. So yes not probably a good thing for Indian Higher Education. You cannot do practices sitting on laptop which needs a proper lab and appraturs like the engineer students the architecture and design students.

NRTI currently offers two M. B.A. Programmes: In Transportation Management and in Supply Chain Management. Admission to NRTI's M. B.A. Programmes is based on subjects studied and aggregate marks in your Bachelor's, along with your CAT (2019)/XAT (2020)/MAT (later than May 2019) scores, an entrance test and a personal interview. Considering the Institutes impressive credentials and track record so far, it seems like a great option to consider for those interested in an M. B.A.
