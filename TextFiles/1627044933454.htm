I have a wonderful experience at IIT Hyderabad.

Placements:
In IIT Hyderabad, I sat for placements, and 82% of the students got placements. Almost 75% of the offers are from international companies. Top recruiting companies for our course are Microsoft, Jaguar Land Rover, Eaton, Bajaj Auto and others. Around 40% of the students got an internship in companies like Sarla Technology and Hyrefox Consultants. Energy engineers are some roles offered here.

Infrastructure:
The college is well-equipped with basic to advanced facilities like a library, gym, cafeteria, hospital and...

IIT Hyderabad has good campus life and culture for students' overall growth.

Placements:
Many students get good salary packages from our college. Some students try for PSUs by writing their respective exams. Placements for CS and electrical are better than other branches. Many students pursue their post-graduation from renowned universities in other countries. Japanese companies are more active in visiting here for placements as there is a good collaboration between IITH and Japanese companies.

Infrastructure:
Most of the facilities which are necessary for students are available on our campus like Wi-Fi, library, medical help, canteen, mid-market, sports equipment and courts or grounds for all the games. Hostels have solar heaters, washing machines, elevators, fire extinguishers, fire alarms, water heaters for hot water and mineral water cans. Every hostel has one security guard. You can enjoy sports facilities better as there are less students compared to equipment. Many buildings are going to get co...

The best college that I have ever seen.

Placements:
Placement in IIT Hyderabad is so much better than other IIT. The average package in CSE is 20 Lacs. The average package in other groups is 14 Lacs. Total 80% members are placed in every batch. I think it's the best place for coding. IIT Hyderabad stands 6th in placements.

Infrastructure:
IIT Hyderabad campus is next level in infrastructure. It was designed by the Japan architecture. I have seen so many IITs but the infrastructure of IIT Hyderabad is the best. But the college is not fully constructed but the ...

Some of the top companies are Microsoft, HSBC, Goldman Sachs, BPCL, Adobe, Honeywell, etc. They offered roles such as process engineer, design engineer, software developer, data analyst.

Review of IIT Hyderabad - Indian Institute of Technology (IITH).

Placements:
Placements scenarios are awesome here as students have the freedom to choose our interest and gain excellence in that. It helps in our overall growth. Top recruiting companies like Google, Microsoft, Goldman Sachs, Flipkart, SAMSUNG R&D, many startups, Amazon visited the campus and offered a decent salary package.

Infrastructure:
First-class facilities in the gym, sports, library, labs, medical, Wi-Fi, hair salon are available inside the campus. A mess is good, but after some time you will get bored by the same menu. For first-year students, they provide p-block hostels due to lack of rooms, and from the second year onwards they provide the main hostel, and they are pretty awesome. They are made on Japenese architecture guidelines these hostel buildings have radiant cooling which not let the room get hot during summer. T...
