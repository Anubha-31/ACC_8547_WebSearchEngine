What is Alternative Medicine?



Alternative medicine is a study of natural medical practices that makes use of ancient techniques to heal the body. It focuses on medical products and practices that are outside the conventional clinical care. Alternative medicine includes dietary supplements, vitamins, natural products, herbal recipes, massage therapy, magnet therapy, and spiritual healing. The effectiveness and scientific relevance of these systems of medicine make them a popular stream of study among young aspirants in India. Some of the popular alternative streams of medicine are Homeopathy, Unani, Ayurveda, and Naturopathy. There are a number of alternative medicine colleges in India offering the course at diploma, undergraduate and postgraduate levels.
